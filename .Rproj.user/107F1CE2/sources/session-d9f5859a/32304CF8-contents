# Why Sample Size Matters

-   \[Explain why AIC is often described as sample-size agnostic\]
-   \[Introduce why AICc changes this\]

# What Is “n” in AICc?

-   \[Define sample size in likelihood-based inference\]
-   \[Distinguish observations from independent information\]

# Pseudoreplication and Inflated n

-   \[Explain how dependence inflates apparent sample size\]
-   \[Describe consequences for model selection penalties\]

# Effective Sample Size

-   \[Define effective sample size conceptually\]
-   \[Relate to clustering, repeated measures, and random effects\]

# Software Pitfalls

-   \[Explain MuMIn::dredge behavior\]
-   \[Discuss risks of automated workflows\]
-   \[Reinforce need for statistical judgment\]

# Practical Guidance

-   \[Describe strategies to estimate effective n\]
-   \[Explain when AICc comparisons become unreliable\]
-   \[Discuss implications for ecological inference\]

# Take-Home Messages

-   \[Emphasize that n is about information, not rows\]
-   \[Reinforce caution with model selection in complex designs\]
