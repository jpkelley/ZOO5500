## Course Roadmap

### General course outline

-   \[List major themes or modules to be covered\]
-   \[Indicate how topics build on one another\]

## Course Roadmap

The course progresses as follows:

General course outline

-   Data exploration, outliers, visual inspection
-   Data heterogeneity (what to do with messy data)
-   Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
-   General principles of model validation
-   Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)
-   Information Theory of Model Selection
-   Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and their mixed model extensions
-   Spatial and temporal autocorrelation
-   Causal inference (transitioning to Bayesian)

We will only scratch the surface of some topics—but enough to convince you why they matter.

## How This Course Is Structured

We will work in **small groups**, and you will also work extensively with **your own data**. By early October (around October 4), your dataset should be in *working order*—not just technically usable, but conceptually ready to explain to others.

::: callout-note
**Working order does not mean “a single spreadsheet.”**\
A dataset is only complete if it includes **metadata**.
:::

Metadata describe: - what the variables are\
- how the data were collected\
- under what conditions\
- with what assumptions and limitations

If you have questions about metadata, I have a dedicated lecture on metadata structures, and I strongly encourage you to reach out.

### What to expect next

-   \[Describe what will happen in the remainder of the first class\]
-   \[Outline upcoming assignments or activities\]

## Meetings and Expectations

On our first in-person meeting, we will: - do brief class introductions\
- discuss statistical philosophy\
- go through example problems\
- talk about common analytical pitfalls to avoid

This assumes you have **watched or skimmed** the asynchronous videos beforehand.

This course is designed to be cumulative and interactive—preparation matters.

## Getting Started

### Who are you?

-   \[Prompt students to introduce themselves\]
-   \[Encourage sharing of disciplinary background\]

### Your data

-   \[Ask students to describe the data they work with or hope to work with\]
-   \[Surface common challenges and anxieties\]

### Your concerns and expectations

-   \[Invite discussion of fears, gaps, or uncertainties\]
-   \[Frame these as normal and productive\]
