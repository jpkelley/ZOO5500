## Goals this week

This week, you will be exposed to (or reminded about?!) some ways of organizing file structures for creating a reproducible analysis. Note that other courses here at UW cover the concepts of reproducible analytical workflows --i.e. the use of GitHub, formalized workflows, metadata, and repositories-- in great detail. This course abbreviates some of those concepts and best practices, doing just enough to allow us to focus on statistical modeling. Feel free to apply what you have learned in other courses.

Download and install R and RStudio: This is just a reminder to make sure everything is working. Set up a project. You can do this on your own (in RStudio, create new project in an existing directory). Set up a file structure in your RStudio project. Import your dataset: Just as a reminder, you should already have an organized dataset (either one or more files). If these files are already in .csv format, keep them as such, as this is a widely recognized file format that ensures data long-term stability (.xlsx and such formats are not). These files will be placed in your Google Drive analysis folder. Data should be long (rather than wide) format, but don't worry about this distinction if you don't want to bother with it at this point.
