## The Core Goal of the Course

## Why this course?

The benefit of this course is to not only teach you about statistics (and some statistical traps), but to have you working with your peers as you delve into the issues that inevitably arise with your own data analysis. Learning how to navigate data analysis issues is a skill that is critical for developing researchers. Please try to make this class as useful as possible for you and include most or all of the analyses that you expect will go into one of your dissertation chapters. You can just include one analysis if that is all that you need or you can include 4-5 analyses if that is what you need to answer your question(s). This is an opportunity for you to get more help with data analysis, so take advantage.

The central goal of this course is to guide you through the transition:

> **Messy field or lab data → processed data → models → inference**

You have already collected data. Now we focus on: - understanding what those data actually are\
- identifying patterns\
- building appropriate models\
- validating and selecting those models\
- making inference and generating new hypotheses

We will take a **frequentist approach** in this course. We will *not* cover Bayesian modeling in detail, though many ideas—especially model structure and philosophy—transfer directly.

Bayesian approaches are increasingly common and powerful, and this may change over the next 5–10 years. However, the foundational ideas about data structure, scale, and modeling assumptions are shared across frameworks.

## Meetings and Expectations

On our first in-person meeting, we will: - do brief class introductions\
- discuss statistical philosophy\
- go through example problems\
- talk about common analytical pitfalls to avoid

This assumes you have **watched or skimmed** the asynchronous videos beforehand.

This course is designed to be cumulative and interactive—preparation matters.
