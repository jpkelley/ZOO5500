## Analysis Concept Note

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 2  
**Purpose:** Lock in a feasible analysis plan early, so you’re not improvising later. This is about *scope, clarity, and workflow*, not results.

### What to include
- **Working title** (can change later)
- **Your focal question** (1–3 sentences; plain language)
- **Study system + units of analysis** (what is one “row” conceptually?)
- **Response variable(s)** and **predictor(s)** you expect to use (draft list is fine)
- **Hypothesized relationships** (short bullets; directionality when you can)
- **Data source + file plan**
  - Where the data live
  - What you will name files
  - What the folder structure will be
- **Planned model family (tentative)**  
  e.g., GLM / GLMM / GAM / GAMM, and *why* that’s your first guess
- **Potential complications** you already suspect (missing data, non-independence, zero inflation, seasonality, etc.)

### Submission format
- 1–2 pages (PDF) **or** a short Quarto/Markdown page
- Clear headings (don’t bury the key info)

### “Good” looks like
- A question that is answerable with the data you actually have
- Reasonable scope for one semester
- A workflow plan that makes your project reproducible from day one

## Data Readiness Note

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 4  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate that your dataset is *analysis-ready* (or identify exactly what still blocks you). This is your chance to be honest about limitations before modeling.

### What to include
- **Dataset summary**
  - Number of rows/observations
  - Key grouping structure (site, individual, date, etc.)
- **Data dictionary (lightweight)**
  - Variable name → meaning → units → type (numeric/factor/date)
- **Missingness + exclusions**
  - What’s missing, where, and what you did about it (if anything)
- **Measurement & uncertainty notes**
  - Known measurement error, detection limits, observer effects, instrument drift, etc.
- **Basic EDA outputs (minimal but informative)**
  - 1–3 plots that reveal structure (distributions, relationships, time trends)
  - A short paragraph interpreting what matters
- **Readiness decision**
  - “Ready to model” **or** “Not ready yet,” with a clear plan to get there

### Submission format
- 1–2 pages (PDF) **or** Quarto page with embedded plots

### “Good” looks like
- You can explain what each variable means and whether it’s trustworthy
- You’ve surfaced the biggest problems *early*
- Your EDA is purposeful, not a plot dump

## Working Model (draft)

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 7  
**Purpose:** Put a real model on the table. This is a draft: imperfect is fine, but it must be runnable and defensible.

### What to include
- **Your current model formula(s)** (in plain language and/or code notation)
- **Model type** (GLM, GLMM, GAM, etc.) and why it fits the data structure
- **Key diagnostics or checks (draft level)**
  - Anything that suggests it’s “in the ballpark” or clearly broken
- **One short interpretation paragraph**
  - What the model suggests (careful language; no over-claiming)
- **A short “known issues” list**
  - What you know is wrong or incomplete
  - What you plan to try next

### Submission format
- Quarto page (preferred) **or** PDF with model description + outputs
- Include enough detail that someone else could reproduce the model from your write-up

### “Good” looks like
- A runnable model that is aligned with your question
- Honest diagnostics and a clear plan to improve

---

## Working Model (final lock)

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 8  
**Purpose:** Freeze the core model so the rest of the semester can focus on prediction, interpretation, and reporting (instead of endless tinkering).

### What to include
- **Final model specification**
  - Final formula, family/link, random effects or smooths, correlation structures if used
- **Justification**
  - Why this structure is appropriate for the data and the question
- **Model checks**
  - A small set of diagnostics that you can defend
  - Notes on remaining limitations
- **What changes are no longer allowed**
  - After the lock, you can refine presentation and interpretation, but you should not “keep shopping” for a different model without a compelling reason.

### Submission format
- Quarto page (preferred) **or** PDF
- Include key outputs you’ll rely on later (even if you later improve figures)

### “Good” looks like
- A stable model you can explain to a skeptical reader
- Evidence you tested assumptions rather than hoping

---

## Interpretation Memo

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 12  
**Purpose:** Practice disciplined interpretation and uncertainty-aware reasoning. This is where you show that you can tell the truth about what the model does (and does not) say.

### What to include
- **The main result(s)** in plain language
- **Uncertainty**
  - What is uncertain and why
  - Confidence intervals/credible intervals, prediction intervals, or other appropriate summaries
- **Prediction vs inference clarity**
  - Are you predicting new cases, explaining mechanisms, or both?
- **Sensitivity / robustness (lightweight)**
  - One small check that increases confidence (or reveals fragility)
- **Limitations**
  - The most important threats to inference and how they affect interpretation

### Submission format
- ~1–2 pages (PDF) **or** Quarto page
- Emphasis on writing quality and intellectual restraint

### “Good” looks like
- Clear, honest claims tied directly to model output
- Uncertainty is centered, not hidden
- No “story time” beyond what the evidence supports

---

## Results Section

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 14  
**Purpose:** Draft the Results section you would submit in a real paper/report: concise, structured, and supported by tables/figures.

### What to include
- **A short orienting paragraph**
  - What you modeled and what the reader should look for
- **Core results**
  - 2–4 key findings (depending on project scope)
- **Tables and/or figures**
  - Clean, interpretable, labeled, and referenced in text
- **Minimal interpretation**
  - Results should state what you found; deeper interpretation comes later (or is clearly separated)

### Submission format
- Quarto page (ideal) **or** PDF
- Include figure/table captions

### “Good” looks like
- The reader can understand your findings without reading your code
- Figures/tables do real work (not decoration)
- Claims match the evidence shown

---

## Full Draft

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 15  
**Purpose:** Assemble a complete, coherent draft that reads like a real scientific product. This is where structure and flow matter.

### What to include
- **At minimum:** Introduction / Methods / Results / Discussion (or equivalent structure)
- **Consistent terminology**
  - Variable names, units, and definitions don’t drift
- **All figures/tables in near-final form**
- **References / citations** (as appropriate for your format)

### Submission format
- Quarto render (HTML or PDF) preferred
- If PDF, ensure figures/tables are legible and captions are present

### “Good” looks like
- A document that could be improved into something publishable with revision
- Clear logic and honest uncertainty
- No missing major components

---

## Revision Plan (not executed)

**When it appears in the calendar:** Week 16  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate that you can revise strategically. You will not execute the revisions; you will propose them.

### What to include
- **Top 5 revision priorities**
  - Ranked, with a sentence on why each is high priority
- **What you would change (specific)**
  - “Rewrite paragraph X to clarify Y”
  - “Replace Figure 2 with a plot that shows Z”
- **What evidence you’d need**
  - Additional checks, additional plots, sensitivity analyses, etc.
- **If you had 10 more hours**
  - What would you do first?
- **If you had 40 more hours**
  - What would you do that you can’t do now?

### Submission format
- 1 page (PDF) or short Quarto page

### “Good” looks like
- Specific, actionable revisions (not vague “improve writing”)
- Prioritized and realistic
- Shows mature judgment about what actually improves inference and communication
