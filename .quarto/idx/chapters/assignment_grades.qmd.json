Each template is formatted using Quarto Markdown, which is preferred to R Markdown. While R Markdown is **not** obsolete by any means, it has a number of disadvantages compared to Quarto; these are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Dimension         | R Markdown  | Quarto                     |\n| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| age               | older       | newer                      |\n| primary language  | R           | multi-language             |\n| document types    | reports     | docs, books, sites, slides |\n| cross-referencing | manual      | built-in                   |\n| extensibility     | constrained | modular                    |\n\nSo, in your own work, if you ever anticipate wanting to streamline your workflow, I recommend migrating your old R Markdown files to Quarto. Note that there are a few steps to do so, steps that involve changing file headers and syntax. I have had to do this with my older R Markdown files, and it doesn't take much time. Quarto can really add huge advantages, including reproducible creation of scientific presentations (sometimes in minutes and not hours). \n\nFor this course, please use Quarto.\n\n\n## Grading\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\nNumerical grades are downright loathsome.

It just means there are certain elements that you should tighten up before moving on.\nRed is also **not** bad. It just means there are *more* elements that you should tighten up before moving on.\nHmm...see a pattern here?

My goal here is to make expectations clear, keep grading transparent, and help you focus on doing solid, defensible science --all without unnecessary stress over points or formatting (which we will let GenAI work on for you). The scale's primary benefits include:\n\n-   **It is easy to read.** The traffic light color scheme (green, yellow, and red) tell you right away whether your work is ready to move forward, needs some fixing, or needs a more substantial rethink (the majority of good scientists' ideas)\n-   **It is the same for every assignment.** I use this scale for all milestone assignments. Therefore, the standards are predictable for every assignment.\n-   **It centers on scientific readiness, not scientific perfection** (which, technically, does not exist). You are not being graded on having the “right” answer. What matters most to me is whether your question, data, and reasoning co-exist coherently together.\n-   **It matches how real science works.** Research almost never gets it right on the first try; drafts, checks, and revisions are normal.\n-   **It allows for rapid feedback.** GenAI will do some of the busy work associated with troubleshooting coding issues or improving clarity, which will give me more time to gauge the scientific readiness of your work.
