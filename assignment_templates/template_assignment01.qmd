## Project overview {.unnumbered}

### Working title {.unnumbered}
*(This can change later)*

> _Insert a concise, descriptive working title._

---

### Research question {.unnumbered}

> _State your primary question in 1–3 sentences, in plain language._  
> _Avoid methods or results language here._

---

### Study system and units of analysis {.unnumbered}

- **Study system / context:**  
  _Brief description of the biological, ecological, or applied system._

- **Unit of analysis:**  
  _What does a single row represent conceptually? (e.g., individual, site-day, plot-year, detection event, etc.)_

---

## Data description {.unnumbered}

### Data source {.unnumbered}

- Where do the data come from?  
- Are they observational, experimental, or simulated?  
- Are you the original data collector?

---

### Response variable(s) {.unnumbered}

List your primary response variable(s):

- Variable name (as it appears in the data):  
- What it represents conceptually:  
- Measurement scale / type (count, binary, continuous, proportion, etc.):  
- Units (if applicable):

---

### Predictor variable(s) {.unnumbered}

List your main predictors (draft list is fine):

- Predictor name:  
- Conceptual meaning:  
- Expected direction of effect (if any):  
- Why it matters for your question:

---

## Hypotheses and expectations {.unnumbered}

> _Briefly describe the relationships you expect to see._  
> _Bullets are fine. Directional expectations are helpful but not required._

---

## Planned analytical approach (tentative) {.unnumbered}

### Candidate model family {.unnumbered}

> _What type of model do you currently think is appropriate, and why?_  
> _(GLM, GLMM, GAM, GAMM, etc. — this is a hypothesis, not a commitment.)_

---

### Data structure considerations {.unnumbered}

Note anything you already suspect may matter:

- Non-independence (grouping, repeated measures, hierarchy)
- Temporal structure
- Spatial structure
- Zero inflation, truncation, bounds
- Unequal sampling effort

---

## Workflow and reproducibility plan {.unnumbered}

### File organization {.unnumbered}

> _Briefly describe how you plan to organize your project files._

- Project root name:
- Data folder(s):
- Script folder(s):
- Output / figures folder(s):

---

### AI use (planned) {.unnumbered}

> _If you anticipate using AI tools, describe how (e.g., troubleshooting, clarification, workflow advice, link to AI Interaction Log)._  
> _Do not include prompts or outputs here._

---

## Anticipated challenges {.unnumbered}

> _What do you already think might be difficult or limiting?_  
> _Examples: missing data, unclear metadata, low sample size, confounding, measurement error._

---

## What success looks like at this stage {.unnumbered}

> _In 2–4 sentences, describe what you would consider a successful outcome for this project by the end of the semester._

---

## Notes for the instructor (optional) {.unnumbered}

> _Anything you want feedback on specifically? Scope, feasibility, model choice, data limitations, etc._

---

## Self-check rubric (complete before submitting) {.unnumbered}

Before submitting, read each item and confirm that your Concept Note meets the standard.

### Clarity and scope
- ☐ My research question is understandable to a classmate outside my subfield  
- ☐ The scope is appropriate for one semester (not overly ambitious)  
- ☐ I can clearly describe what one observation (row) represents  

### Data readiness (conceptual)
- ☐ I know where the data come from and what they represent  
- ☐ I can name my response variable(s) and explain what they measure  
- ☐ I can explain why each main predictor is included  

### Analytical thinking
- ☐ My tentative model choice is motivated by the data structure, not habit  
- ☐ I have considered non-independence, temporal, or spatial structure where relevant  
- ☐ I have identified at least one plausible complication or limitation  

### Workflow and reproducibility
- ☐ I have a clear plan for organizing files and scripts  
- ☐ Someone else could understand my project structure from my description  
- ☐ My planned AI use aligns with course expectations  

### Overall check
- ☐ This document reflects *my current thinking*, not a polished final plan  
- ☐ Uncertainty and open questions are stated honestly  
- ☐ I am ready to receive feedback and revise my approach
