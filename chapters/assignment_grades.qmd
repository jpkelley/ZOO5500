## Milestone Assignment descriptions

::: {.callout-note title="**Analysis Concept Note (Week 2)**" icon="false" collapse="true"}
**Purpose:**\
Lock in a feasible analysis plan early, so you’re not improvising later. This is about scope, clarity, and workflow—not results.

### What to include
[Download the Analysis Concept Note template (.qmd)](../templates/01_template.qmd)

-   Working title (can change later)
-   Your focal question (1–3 sentences; plain language)
-   Study system and units of analysis (what is one “row,” conceptually?)
-   Response variable(s) and predictor(s) you expect to use (draft list is fine)
-   Hypothesized relationships
    -   Short bullets; include directionality when possible
-   Data source and file plan
    -   Where the data live\
    -   What you will name files\
    -   What the folder structure will be
-   Planned model family (tentative)
    -   e.g., GLM / GLMM / GAM / GAMM, and why that’s your first guess
-   Potential complications you already suspect
    -   Missing data, non-independence, zero inflation, seasonality, etc.

### Submission format

-   1–2 pages (PDF) or a short Quarto/Markdown page
-   Clear headings (don’t bury the key information)

### “Good” looks like

-   A question that is answerable with the data you actually have
-   Reasonable scope for one semester
-   A workflow plan that makes your project reproducible from day one
:::

::: {.callout-note title="**Data Readiness Note (Week 4)**" icon="false" collapse="true"}
**Purpose:**\

### What to include

-   Dataset summary
    -   Number of rows/observations\
    -   Key grouping structure (site, individual, date, etc.)
-   Data dictionary (lightweight)
    -   Variable name → meaning → units → type (numeric, factor, date)
-   Missingness and exclusions
    -   What’s missing, where, and what you did about it (if anything)
-   Measurement and uncertainty notes
    -   Known measurement error, detection limits, observer effects, instrument drift, etc.
-   Basic Exploratory Data Analysis outputs (minimal but informative)
    -   1–3 plots that reveal structure (distributions, relationships, time trends)\
    -   A short paragraph interpreting what matters
-   Readiness decision
    -   “Ready to model” or “Not ready yet,” with a clear plan to get there

### Submission format

-   1–2 pages (PDF) or Quarto page with embedded plots

-   Your Exploratory Data Analysis purposeful, not a plot dump
:::

::: {.callout-note title="**Working Model — Draft (Week 7)**" icon="false" collapse="true"}

### What to include

-   Your current model formula(s) (plain language and/or code notation)
-   Model type (GLM, GLMM, GAM, etc.) and why it fits the data structure
-   Key diagnostics or checks (draft level)
    -   Anything that suggests it’s “in the ballpark” or clearly broken
-   One short interpretation paragraph
    -   What the model suggests (careful language; no over-claiming)

## General assignment submission requirements

For all assignments, a template is provided. Each template is formatted using Quarto Markdown, which is preferred to R Markdown. While R Markdown is **not** obsolete by any means, it has a number of disadvantages compared to Quarto; these are summarized in the table below.

| Dimension         | R Markdown  | Quarto                     |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| age               | older       | newer                      |
| primary language  | R           | multi-language             |
| document types    | reports     | docs, books, sites, slides |
| cross-referencing | manual      | built-in                   |
| extensibility     | constrained | modular                    |

So, in your own work, if you ever anticipate wanting to streamline your workflow, I recommend migrating your old R Markdown files to Quarto. Note that there are a few steps to do so, steps that involve changing file headers and syntax. I have had to do this with my older R Markdown files, and it doesn't take much time. Quarto can really add huge advantages, including reproducible creation of scientific presentations (sometimes in minutes and not hours). 

For this course, please use Quarto.


## Grading

::::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
Numerical grades are downright loathsome. For all assignments, I use the Traffic Signal Grading Scale:

| Grade  | Simple meaning   | Scientific judgement                       |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Green  | Good to Proceed  | Scientifically coherent for this milestone |
| Yellow | Exercise Caution | Viable, but revision is required           |
| Red    | Stop and Rework  | Not yet ready for scientific judgment      |

Yellow is **not** bad. It just means there are certain elements that you should tighten up before moving on.
Red is also **not** bad. It just means there are *more* elements that you should tighten up before moving on.
Hmm...see a pattern here? Maybe top-tier science is built upon iterative improvements?

## Universal Milestone Grading Rubric

*The Traffic Signal Grading Scale applies to all Milestone Assignments. Grading reflects scientific readiness relative to the purpose of the milestone.*

| Dimension | 🟢 GREEN: Good to Proceed | 🟡 YELLOW: Exercise Caution | 🔴 RED: Stop and Rework |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Purpose & intent** | Clearly meets the core intent of the milestone | Partially meets intent; key elements need revision | Does not meet the core intent of the milestone |
| **Question or objective** | Clear, focused, and appropriate for this stage | Present but vague, drifting, or overly broad | Unclear, unfocused, or missing |
| **Alignment (question–data–methods)** | Question, data, and approach are coherently aligned | Partial alignment; gaps or weak links remain | Fundamental mismatch between components |
| **Reasoning & assumptions** | Reasoning is coherent; assumptions or limitations acknowledged | Reasoning incomplete or assumptions implicit | Reasoning unclear or unsupported |
| **Claims & language** | Claims are appropriate for the stage of analysis | Some overreach or ambiguous language | Claims exceed what the work can support |
| **Course GPT self-check** | Used appropriately; issues addressed or justified | Used, but issues only partially addressed | Little or no meaningful evidence of self-checking |
| **Scientific readiness** | Work is ready to move to the next stage | Viable but requires targeted revision | Not yet in a usable scientific state |

This universal grading scale is meant to help you quickly understand where your work stands, not to highlight small mistakes. My goal here is to make expectations clear, keep grading transparent, and help you focus on doing solid, defensible science --all without unnecessary stress over points or formatting (which we will let GenAI work on for you). The scale's primary benefits include:

-   **It is easy to read.** The traffic light color scheme (green, yellow, and red) tell you right away whether your work is ready to move forward, needs some fixing, or needs a more substantial rethink (the majority of good scientists' ideas)
-   **It is the same for every assignment.** I use this scale for all milestone assignments. Therefore, the standards are predictable for every assignment.
-   **It centers on scientific readiness, not scientific perfection** (which, technically, does not exist). You are not being graded on having the “right” answer. What matters most to me is whether your question, data, and reasoning co-exist coherently together.
-   **It matches how real science works.** Research almost never gets it right on the first try; drafts, checks, and revisions are normal.
-   **It allows for rapid feedback.** GenAI will do some of the busy work associated with troubleshooting coding issues or improving clarity, which will give me more time to gauge the scientific readiness of your work. A win-win for us all!
