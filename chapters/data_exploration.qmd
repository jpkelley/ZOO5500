## Data Exploration

You have already collected data. Now we focus on: - understanding what those data actually are\
- identifying patterns\
- building appropriate models\
- validating and selecting those models\
- making inference and generating new hypotheses

We will take a **frequentist approach** in this course. We will *not* cover Bayesian modeling in detail, though many ideas—especially model structure and philosophy—transfer directly.

Bayesian approaches are increasingly common and powerful, and this may change over the next 5–10 years. However, the foundational ideas about data structure, scale, and modeling assumptions are shared across frameworks.

## Why Data Exploration Comes First

-   \[Explain the risks of skipping exploratory steps\]
-   \[Frame exploration as hypothesis protection, not data dredging\]

## Step 1: Identifying Outliers

-   \[Define univariate vs. multivariate outliers\]
-   \[Discuss different sources of outliers: error, biology, rare events\]

### Graphical Identification of Univariate Outliers

-   \[Describe Cleveland plots, Tukey boxplots, and conditional boxplots\]
-   \[Explain strengths and weaknesses of each\]

### Statistical vs. Expert Judgment

-   \[Contrast formal statistical rules with biological or domain expertise\]
-   \[Discuss risks of authority-based decisions\]

### Multivariate Outliers

-   \[Introduce Mahalanobis distance and robust alternatives\]
-   \[Explain why univariate methods can fail\]

### What to Do When You Find Outliers

-   \[Outline options: removal, parallel analyses, transformation, or no action\]
-   \[Emphasize transparency and justification\]

## Step 2: Examining Zeroes in the Data

-   \[Explain zero inflation and why it matters\]
-   \[Describe when excess zeroes signal a modeling problem versus a biological pattern\]

## Step 3: Collinearity Among Predictors

-   \[Define collinearity and why it destabilizes models\]
-   \[Contrast implications for frequentist vs. Bayesian models\]

### Detecting Collinearity

-   \[Describe scatterplots, correlation coefficients, and VIFs/GVIFs\]
-   \[Explain interpretation thresholds (e.g., VIF \< 3)\]

### Dealing with Collinearity

-   \[Describe selective variable removal\]
-   \[Introduce PCA as a dimensionality-reduction approach\]
-   \[Discuss biological reasoning in deciding what to retain\]

## Step 4: Considering Interaction Terms

-   \[Explain what interaction terms represent biologically\]
-   \[Discuss sample size constraints and interpretability\]

## Step 5: Standardizing, Scaling, or Leaving Covariates Alone

-   \[Define standardization and centering\]
-   \[Explain how these choices affect interpretation of coefficients and intercepts\]
-   \[Provide guidance on when each approach is appropriate\]

## Step 6: Violations of Homogeneity

-   \[Introduce homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity\]
-   \[Explain why residuals—not raw data—are the focus\]
