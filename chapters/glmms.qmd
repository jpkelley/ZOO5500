format: html

# Overview and Motivation
- [Explain why non-independence is the most serious assumption violation in field data]
- [Describe common sources of dependence in ecological datasets]
- [Position GLMMs as a solution, not a complication]

# What Is Statistical Independence?
- [Define independence formally]
- [Explain why residual independence matters]
- [Distinguish true replication from pseudoreplication]

# Sources of Non-Independence
## Spatial Dependence
- [Describe spatial clustering and scale]
- [Give ecological examples]

## Temporal Dependence
- [Describe repeated measures and time-series effects]
- [Explain year, season, and cohort effects]

## Hierarchical / Organizational Dependence
- [Describe nested and crossed designs]
- [Relate hierarchy to biological organization]

# Diagnosing Non-Independence
- [Describe exploratory plotting approaches]
- [Explain residual diagnostics and autocorrelation checks]
- [Introduce DHARMa conceptually]

# Fixed vs. Random Effects
## Conceptual Distinction
- [Define fixed effects as effects of interest]
- [Define random effects as variance components]
- [Clarify misconceptions about “randomness”]

## Examples
- [Walk through canonical ecological examples]
- [Explain generalizability vs. level-specific inference]

# Structure of GLMMs
- [Describe how GLMMs extend GLMs]
- [Explain role of link functions and distributions]
- [Introduce random intercepts and slopes]

# Random Intercepts
- [Explain when intercept-only random effects are sufficient]
- [Describe interpretation]

# Random Slopes
- [Explain biological meaning of varying slopes]
- [Describe when random slopes are necessary]

# Model Fitting Workflow
- [Outline global-model-first philosophy]
- [Describe choosing random-effect structure a priori]
- [Explain iterative model checking]

# ML vs. REML
- [Explain conceptual difference]
- [Describe when to use each]
- [Explain why REML matters for random effects]

# Model Validation
- [Describe residual checks]
- [Explain what problems remain after adding random effects]

# Common Debates and Pitfalls
- [Minimum number of random-effect levels]
- [Whether to remove variance-free random effects]
- [Overfitting random-effect structures]

# Take-Home Messages
- [Summarize why GLMMs improve inference]
- [Emphasize biological reasoning over mechanical modeling]
