# Overview and Learning Goals

-   \[Explain why model selection is unavoidable in complex systems\]
-   \[Position information theory as an alternative to null-hypothesis testing\]

# Philosophical Foundations

## Multiple Working Hypotheses

-   \[Describe Chamberlin’s framework\]
-   \[Explain relevance to ecology\]
-   \[Connect to strong inference\]

## Model Parsimony

-   \[Explain parsimony conceptually\]
-   \[Describe trade-offs between realism and simplicity\]

# Bias–Variance Tradeoff

-   \[Explain bias and variance intuitively\]
-   \[Relate tradeoff to prediction error\]
-   \[Explain why “best fit” is not the goal\]

# Information Criteria

## Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

-   \[Define AIC mathematically\]
-   \[Explain likelihood and penalty terms\]

## AICc and QAIC

-   \[Explain small-sample correction\]
-   \[Describe overdispersion and QAIC\]

## AIC vs. BIC

-   \[Explain philosophical differences\]
-   \[Clarify when each might be preferred\]

# Candidate Model Sets

-   \[Describe biologically motivated model construction\]
-   \[Explain dangers of post hoc model fishing\]

# Comparing Models

## ΔAIC

-   \[Define and interpret ΔAIC\]

## Akaike Weights

-   \[Explain probabilistic interpretation\]
-   \[Describe evidence ratios\]

## Confidence Sets

-   \[Explain cutoff rules and alternatives\]

# Model Averaging

-   \[Explain rationale for model averaging\]
-   \[Describe full vs. reduced averaging\]
-   \[Explain how uncertainty propagates\]

# Stepwise Selection (Cautionary Section)

-   \[Describe backward and forward stepwise procedures\]
-   \[Explain why stepwise is discouraged\]
-   \[Clarify limited cases where it might be defensible\]

# Strengths and Limitations of AIC

-   \[Explain objectivity advantages\]
-   \[Clarify what AIC does *not* validate\]
-   \[Emphasize need for model checking\]

# Take-Home Messages

-   \[Summarize information-theoretic inference\]
-   \[Reinforce interpretation over decision rules\]
