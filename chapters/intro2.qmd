::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Elevated temperature induces heat-shock gene expression**"}
**Answer:** Causal  
**Why:** The verb *induces* asserts a directional mechanism from temperature to gene expression.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Foraging duration and prey density are negatively associated in seabirds**"}
**Answer:** Associational  
**Why:** The statement reports a relationship without asserting a mechanism or direction of effect.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Forest fragmentation reduces nesting success**"}
**Answer:** Causal  
**Why:** The phrase *reduces* explicitly claims that fragmentation produces a change in nesting success.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Heat-shock gene expression is associated with ambient temperature**"}
**Answer:** Associational  
**Why:** The wording describes a correlation pattern without implying intervention or mechanism.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Nitrogen availability causes faster leaf expansion**"}
**Answer:** Causal  
**Why:** The verb *causes* signals a direct causal claim about nitrogen’s effect on growth.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Metabolic rate and activity level are associated across mammals**"}
**Answer:** Associational  
**Why:** The statement summarizes a cross-species pattern without claiming direction or mechanism.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Bird species richness is higher in forested landscapes**"}
**Answer:** Associational  
**Why:** This reports a pattern across landscapes but does not assert that forest cover drives richness.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Higher prey density shortens foraging trips**"}
**Answer:** Causal  
**Why:** The verb *shortens* implies that prey density actively changes foraging behavior.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Increased activity elevates metabolic rate**"}
**Answer:** Causal  
**Why:** The statement claims a physiological mechanism linking activity to metabolism.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" icon="false" title="**Tree growth and temperature are associated after accounting for elevation**"}
**Answer:** Associational  
**Why:** Conditioning on elevation defines a conditional association without asserting causation.

## 1. Start with the Data-Generating Process

**Goal:** Break students out of *“data = spreadsheet”* thinking.

Statistical models begin with an idea about how the data were produced. Numbers do not appear magically; they are outcomes of ecological, biological, or sampling processes. Thinking this way helps us choose appropriate models later, rather than forcing data to fit familiar tools.

### Key ideas

- Data are outcomes of **real processes**
- Variables imply:
  - mechanisms
  - constraints (bounds, discreteness)
  - randomness
- Modeling starts before statistics

**Framing line:**  
> Models are hypotheses about how the data were generated.

---

## 2. Signal vs Noise (Why Models Exist)

**Goal:** Introduce error *before* statistics.

Observed data contain both structure we want to explain and variation we cannot. Statistical models exist to separate these components. Importantly, unexplained variation is not a failure—it is an inherent feature of natural systems.

### Key ideas

- Observed data = **signal + noise**
- Noise is part of the process, not a nuisance
- Different processes produce different noise patterns

This motivates:
- residuals
- error distributions
- model assumptions

**Teaching pivot:**  
> Normality assumptions are about what the model fails to explain, not the phenomenon itself.

---

## 3. Data Distributions as Stories About Noise

**Goal:** Make distributions feel scientific, not technical.

Distributions describe how unexplained variation behaves. Choosing a distribution is not a mathematical trick—it is a scientific statement about how randomness arises in the system.

### Key ideas

- **Gaussian** → additive continuous noise
- **Poisson** → variability in counts
- **Binomial** → uncertainty from trials
- **Gamma** → positive, right-skewed accumulation
- Zero-inflation → excess structural zeros

**Core message:**  
> Choosing a distribution is choosing a story about how randomness arises.

---

## 4. Why Ecologists Are (Quietly) Doing Causality

**Goal:** Reframe *“association”* language.

Ecological models are rarely atheoretical. Predictors are chosen because we believe they influence outcomes. Even when we use associational language, our interpretations, predictions, and management decisions rely on causal assumptions.

### Key ideas

- Predictors are biologically motivated
- Models are directional by construction
- Inference often implies causal belief

**Key line:**  
> Correlation is what the math gives you; causality is what the science is trying to argue.

---

## 5. ANOVAs and *t*-tests as Special Cases

**Goal:** Demystify classical statistics and lower resistance.

Traditional tests like *t*-tests and ANOVAs are not fundamentally different tools—they are special cases of linear models with specific assumptions.

Simulation examples show that *t*-tests, ANOVAs, and GLMs give **identical test statistics** when testing the same hypothesis under the same assumptions.

### Key ideas

- *t*-tests and ANOVAs are linear models
- They assume:
  - Gaussian errors
  - identity link
- They test the same hypotheses as GLMs

**Crucial reframing:**  
> We don’t abandon ANOVAs — we outgrow them.

---

## 6. The Structure of the GLM

**Goal:** Show how everything connects.

Generalized linear models separate the parts of a model that describe signal from those that describe noise. This separation is what gives the framework its flexibility.

### Three components

1. **Random component**  
   - Error distribution  
   - Describes variance and noise  

2. **Systematic component**  
   - Linear predictor  
   - Encodes hypotheses and structure  

3. **Link function**  
   - Connects predictors to the mean of the response  
   - Ensures predictions respect natural bounds  

### Key clarifications

- The link acts on the **mean**, not the data
- Linear regression is a GLM with:
  - Gaussian errors
  - identity link

**One-liner:**  
> GLMs separate what varies, why it varies, and how randomness behaves.

---

## 7. Why GLMs Are So Powerful

**Goal:** Explain why this framework dominates modern ecology.

GLMs unify many traditional tests while offering greater flexibility. They handle real-world data complications that classical methods struggle with.

### Key advantages

- Robust to **unbalanced sample sizes**
- Appropriate for **non-normal data**
- Respect **natural data boundaries**
- Allow meaningful visualization of modeled effects
- Easily extended to more complex models

---

## 8. From GLMs to GLMMs (Briefly)

**Goal:** Introduce hierarchy as structure, not complication.

Many ecological data sets include clustering, repeated measures, or shared history. GLMMs extend GLMs by modeling this dependence explicitly.

### Key ideas

- Random effects encode dependence
- They represent structure, not error correction
- They improve inference when data are non-independent

**Position GLMMs as:**  
> Models of conditional independence, not magic bullets.

---

## 9. Diagnostics as Questions, Not Rituals

**Goal:** Avoid checklist thinking.

Model diagnostics are tools for asking whether the model you built is consistent with the data and the biology—not boxes to check mechanically.

### Frame diagnostics as

- Is the noise behaving as assumed?
- Is there unmodeled structure?
- Are predictions biologically reasonable?

### Key emphasis

- Assumptions apply to **residuals**, not raw data
- Structured residuals indicate model misspecification
- Many problems disappear with better model choice

**Closing line:**  
> Diagnostics ask whether the imaginary world you built still resembles reality.

## Suggested Lecture Arc (One Sentence Each)

- Data come from processes  
- Processes generate signal and noise  
- Distributions describe noise  
- Ecology rarely stops at correlation  
- Classical tests are simple models  
- GLMs unify everything  
- GLMMs add structure  
- Diagnostics test the story

## Meta-Teaching Insight

If students understand:
- data-generating processes
- signal vs noise
- residual-based reasoning
- biological motivation of predictors

Then GLMs stop being *“advanced statistics”* and become:

> a formal language for ecological thinking
