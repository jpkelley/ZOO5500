## Statistical Philosophy and Practice

### A culture of the imperfect

-   \[Introduce aphorisms about imperfection and pragmatism\]
-   \[Discuss why waiting for the “perfect” analysis is often counterproductive\]

### Avoiding statistical traps

-   \[Describe common analytical pitfalls\]
-   \[Emphasize critical reading of others’ analyses\]

### Multiple valid paths

-   \[Introduce the idea that many analytical approaches can be defensible\]
-   \[Connect to collaboration and intellectual humility\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patterns, Models, and Inference

### Detecting patterns

-   \[Describe visualization and exploratory analysis as pattern discovery\]
-   \[Emphasize skepticism and iteration\]

### Models as tools, not truths

-   \[Explain what models are (and are not)\]
-   \[Discuss assumptions, simplifications, and abstraction\]

### Inference and uncertainty

-   \[Describe uncertainty, variability, and confidence\]
-   \[Distinguish statistical significance from scientific importance\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits of Conventional Modeling

### Standard models you already know

-   \[Briefly list GLMs, GAMs, GLMMs, etc.\]
-   \[Acknowledge their usefulness\]

### Why these models are often insufficient

-   \[Discuss complexity, nonlinearity, dependence, and scale\]
-   \[Explain mismatch between data-generating processes and model assumptions\]

### What the “ideal” might look like

-   \[Pose the question of ideal inference without answering it fully\]
-   \[Frame this as a motivating tension for the course\]
