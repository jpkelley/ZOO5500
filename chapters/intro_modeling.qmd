## 1. Start with the Data-Generating Process

**Goal:** Break students out of *“data = spreadsheet”* thinking.

### Key ideas

- Data are outcomes of **processes**, not abstract numbers
- Every variable implies:
  - a mechanism
  - constraints (bounds, discreteness)
  - inherent randomness

**Framing line:**  
> Models are hypotheses about how the data were generated.

This sets up everything that follows.

## 2. Signal vs Noise (Why Models Exist)

**Goal:** Introduce error *before* statistics.

### Key ideas

- Observed data = **systematic structure (signal)** + **unexplained variation (noise)**
- Noise is not a nuisance — it is part of the process
- Different processes generate different kinds of noise

This naturally motivates:
- error distributions
- residuals
- why assumptions exist at all

**Teaching pivot:**  
> Normality assumptions are about what the model fails to explain, not the phenomenon itself.

## 3. Data Distributions as Stories About Noise

**Goal:** Make distributions feel scientific, not technical.

### Key ideas

- **Gaussian** → additive continuous noise
- **Poisson** → counting variability
- **Binomial** → trial-based uncertainty
- **Gamma** → positive, right-skewed accumulation

**Core message:**  
> Choosing a distribution is choosing a story about how randomness arises.

This flows directly into GLMs.

## 4. Why Ecologists Are (Quietly) Doing Causality

**Goal:** Reframe *“association”* language.

### Key ideas

- Ecologists motivate predictors biologically
- Models are directional by construction
- Management, prediction, and climate inference require causal belief

### Introduce

- implicit causality
- counterfactual thinking (light touch)
- why sensitivity analysis exists

**Key line:**  
> Correlation is what the math gives you; causality is what the science is trying to argue.

## 5. ANOVAs and *t*-tests as Special Cases

**Goal:** Demystify classical statistics and lower resistance.

### Key ideas

- *t*-tests and ANOVAs are **linear models**
- They assume:
  - Gaussian errors
  - identity link
- Group means = predictors with factor coding

**Crucial reframing:**  
> We don’t abandon ANOVAs — we outgrow them.

This primes GLMs as a generalization, not a replacement.

## 6. The Structure of the GLM

**Goal:** Show how everything connects.

### Three components

1. **Random component** — distribution → noise  
2. **Systematic component** — linear predictor → signal  
3. **Link function** — connects the two  

### Key clarifications

- The link acts on the **mean**, not the data
- The distribution constrains support and variance
- Linear regression is just a GLM with an identity link and Gaussian errors

**One-liner:**  
> GLMs separate what varies, why it varies, and how randomness behaves.

---

## 7. From GLMs to GLMMs (Briefly)

**Goal:** Introduce hierarchy as structure, not complication.

### Key ideas

- Random effects model shared history or dependence
- They don’t *fix* bad models
- They encode biological or sampling structure

**Position GLMMs as:**  
> Models of conditional independence, not magic bullets.

---

## 8. Diagnostics as Questions, Not Rituals

**Goal:** Avoid checklist thinking.

### Frame diagnostics as

- Is the noise behaving as assumed?
- Is there unmodeled structure?
- Are predictions reasonable?

### Key checks

- residual patterns
- dispersion
- leverage / influence
- biological plausibility

**Closing line:**  
> Diagnostics ask whether the imaginary world you built still resembles reality.

## Suggested Lecture Arc (One Sentence Each)

- Data come from processes  
- Processes generate signal and noise  
- Distributions describe noise  
- Ecology rarely stops at correlation  
- Classical tests are just simple models  
- GLMs unify everything  
- GLMMs add structure  
- Diagnostics test the story

## Meta-Teaching Insight

If students understand:
- data-generating processes
- signal vs noise
- unit-level reasoning

Then GLMs stop being *“advanced statistics”* and become:

> a formal language for ecological thinking

That’s the throughline worth preserving as you integrate the old material.
