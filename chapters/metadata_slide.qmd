## Why Metadata Come *Before* Modeling

Metadata do not merely document data. They **define what hypotheses are meaningful and what models are allowed**.

> **Metadata define what questions your data can answer.  
> Hypotheses choose which of those questions you ask.  
> Models are how you attempt to answer them.**

---

## Three Types of Metadata (Overview)

Ecological datasets require **three distinct layers of metadata**:

1. **Structural metadata:** what is in the file  
2. **Measurement metadata:** how values were generated  
3. **Contextual metadata:** why the dataset looks the way it does  

Each metadata layer constrains hypotheses and model choices in different ways.

## Structural Metadata  
### *What the dataset literally contains*

Includes:

- Variable names and definitions
- Units and scales
- Data types
- Allowed values / factor levels
- Missing-value codes

Structural metadata determine:

- What variables exist
- What transformations are meaningful
- What distributions and link functions are plausible

> Structural metadata answer:  
> **“What hypotheses can even be expressed with these data?”**

---

## Measurement Metadata  
### *How each value came into existence*

Includes:

- Instruments, observers
- Measurement protocols
- Calibration or standardization
- Accuracy, precision, resolution
- Human judgment vs sensor output

Measurement metadata determine:

- Whether variables are direct measurements or proxies
- Whether values are comparable across space, time, or observers
- Whether detection or measurement-error models are required

> Measurement metadata answer:  
> **“What do these variables actually represent in the real world?”**

---

## Contextual Metadata  
### *Why the dataset looks the way it does*

Includes:

- Study design and sampling unit
- Spatial and temporal scope
- Constraints and biases
- Missingness mechanisms
- Known limitations

Contextual metadata determine:

- What comparisons are valid
- Whether observations are independent
- Whether hypotheses are testable at all

> Contextual metadata answer:  
> **“What variation does this dataset genuinely support?”**

---

## Metadata constrain hypotheses

Metadata constrain hypotheses by:
- Limiting temporal or spatial claims (e.g. annual or daily variation)
- Defining whether effects concern abundance, detection, or measurement
- Limiting contrasts due to design (and/or missing data)

> You cannot suggest hypotheses that your metadata do not support.

---

## Metadata establish estimands

Before any model is chosen, metadata already determine:
- What quantity is being estimated
- What variation is treated as signal vs noise
- What interpretations are defensible

> **The estimand is fixed when the data are generated —-  
> not after the model is fit.**

---

## Metadata constrain model types

Metadata constrain entire *classes* of models:

- Structural metadata → distributions, link functions, transformations (proper)  
- Measurement metadata → detection submodels, measurement-error terms  
- Contextual metadata → random effects, repeated measures, causal/descriptive framing  

> Models are not chosen to “fit the data.”  
> Models are chosen to respect what the data *are*.
