## **Why this matters**

- Defensible inference starts with **what your data are**
- Most confusion comes from mixing:
  - **measurand** (what you wish to measure)
  - **data** (recorded outputs)
  - **estimand** (what your model estimates)
- No modeling skill fixes unclear foundations

## **Metrology (science of measurement)**

- A framework for measurement that emphasizes:
  - **traceability** to standards
  - **uncertainty**
  - **reproducibility** across time/people/tools
- Happens **upstream of analysis** (at data generation)

**Key idea:** measurement is not “just a number”

---

## **Measurand**

- **Conceptual quantity in the world** to be measured
- Exists **independently** of observers and instruments
- Defined **before measurement**
- Almost never directly observed

Examples: true wing length, true activity level, real abundance

---

## **Estimand**

- Quantity a **statistical model is designed to estimate**
- Defined by:
  - scientific question **and**
  - data + measurement process + assumptions + model
- Defined **before analysis**
- Not the same as the measurand

Examples: mean wing length in sampled population; expected activity level under sampling design; abundance under a specified model

## **Measurand vs estimand (quick compare)**

| Concept | Measurand | Estimand |
|---|---|---|
| Nature | scientific / conceptual | statistical / formal |
| Exists without data? | yes | no |
| Depends on model? | no | yes |
| Defined when? | before measurement | before estimation |

## **Where each belongs in a paper**

| Concept | Paper section |
|---|---|
| Measurand | Introduction |
| Estimand | Methods |
| Estimate | Results |
| Interpretation (back to measurand) | Discussion |

## **What are data?**

- **Data** = recorded facts from measurement
- **Information** = what we extract from data using models + assumptions
- We do not collect “information” — we collect data, then create information

**Reproducibility requires this distinction**

---

## **Raw data**

**Raw data** = facts produced at observation time, preserved **without post-hoc modification**

Examples:
- on-device audio waveforms
- collar GPS logs (pre-download edits)
- field datasheet counts (pre-transcription edits)
- camera sensor pixel values

**Common misconceptions (not raw):**
- cleaned/tidy tables
- summaries/aggregates
- “analysis-ready” spreadsheets

**Takeaway:** raw data need **metadata** (context) to be reusable
