## Part I: Naming Conventions and Data Organization

\[Based primarily on the Naming Conventions lecture :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index="0"}\]

## Why Naming Conventions Matter

-   \[Explain why variable names, file names, and coding style influence collaboration, reproducibility, and long-term scalability\]
-   \[Discuss how unconventional naming can cause downstream problems in analysis\]

## Common Naming Conventions

-   \[Describe camelCase, PascalCase, and snake_case\]
-   \[Explain why snake_case is typically preferred in R and data science\]

## General Rules for Naming Data Objects

-   \[Outline rules about avoiding spaces, special characters, leading numbers, and inconsistent capitalization\]
-   \[Describe best practices for handling dates, missing values, and metadata\]

## Naming Variables vs. Naming Functions

-   \[Explain the noun/verb distinction for objects and functions\]
-   \[Provide guidance on clarity versus brevity\]

## Coding Style and the Tidyverse

-   \[Introduce the tidyverse style guide and its role in standardization\]
-   \[Describe tools such as `lintr` and `styler` and what problems they solve\]

## Data File Formats and Dataset Management

-   \[Compare acceptable formats for small datasets (CSV, TSV)\]
-   \[Introduce efficient formats for larger datasets (e.g., parquet) and why they matter\]

## Becoming a Better Statistical Programmer

-   \[Encourage iterative improvement of existing projects\]
-   \[Discuss professional responsibility in collaborative data management\]
