# Overview

-   \[Explain why proportion data are common in ecology\]
-   \[Describe why they require special treatment\]

# Why Gaussian Models Fail

-   \[Explain bounded nature of proportion data\]
-   \[Describe impossible predictions (\<0, \>1)\]

# Binary Data (0/1 Outcomes)

## Binomial GLMs

-   \[Describe binomial likelihood\]
-   \[Explain relationship to logistic regression\]

## Link Functions

-   \[Describe logit, probit, cloglog, and others\]
-   \[Explain when to use each\]
-   \[Discuss imbalance in 0s and 1s\]

## Interpretation and Back-Transformation

-   \[Explain link vs. response scale\]
-   \[Describe how to compute probabilities\]

# Model Validation for Binary Data

-   \[Explain why residuals are tricky\]
-   \[Introduce DHARMa as preferred approach\]

# Continuous Proportion Data (0–1)

-   \[Distinguish counts from decimal proportions\]
-   \[Explain why beta distribution is appropriate\]

# Modeling Strategies

## Quasibinomial with Offsets

-   \[Explain multiplication and offsets\]
-   \[Discuss preservation of precision\]

## Beta GLMs and GAMs

-   \[Describe assumptions and advantages\]
-   \[Discuss handling of 0s and 1s\]

# Scaling, Precision, and Inference

-   \[Explain why results should be invariant to numerator/denominator\]
-   \[Discuss impact on standard errors\]
-   \[Explain Type I error inflation\]

# Model Comparison

-   \[Describe testing distributions and link functions with AIC\]
-   \[Emphasize robustness checks\]

# Take-Home Messages

-   \[Summarize best practices\]
-   \[Reinforce focus on proportions, not raw counts\]
