This course is designed so that your **final product** (Methods + Results + start of Discussion / primary inferences) is built **incrementally** across Milestone Assignments. The fastest way to struggle in this course is to choose a project that is “interesting” but not **workable** (either because it is too big, or it is beyond your current experience level). The fastest way to thrive is to choose a project that is both **meaningful** to _you_ and also has a clearly defined **scope**.

Below are a few concrete recommendations for scoping a project that is:

- **Maximally helpful** for your scientific growth  
- Something you can **think deeply about** all semester  
- Something where building an analysis **infrastructure** that rewards you now and later  
- Something that helps you progress toward your **degree**
- Something that **excites you** enough to keep returning to it

## The big idea: pick a data analysis project that benefits from the course topics

Every milestone is a checkpoint that asks you to refine the *same* project:

- Week 2: Analysis Concept Note (scope + design clarity + workflow plan)
- Week 4: Data Readiness Note (data trustworthiness + Exploratory Data Analysis with purpose)
- Week 7–8: Working Model (runnable → defensible → locked)
- Week 12: Interpretation Memo (uncertainty-aware reasoning)
- Week 14: Results Section (clear, concise quantitative reporting)
- Week 15: Full Draft (coherent paper-like product)
- Week 16: Revision Plan (strategic improvement thinking)

A well-scoped project means each milestone feels like a **natural next step**, not a complete and uncomfortable reset. 

Below are five Principles of Scoping for projects in this course (click on the boxes to expand):

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
### **Scoping Principle #1: “You only get one semester of attention”**

Choose a question that you will be happy thinking about repeatedly but only for this finite, semester-long period. If the project is too small, there is a danger that you may become bored. If the project is too big and ambitious, you will likely drown in a turbulent sea of discontent (and then blame me or your housemate).

A good scope has:

- One central question (plain language; 1–3 sentences)
- One primary response variable (or a tightly related pair)
- A manageable predictor set (start small; justify later additions)
- A clear unit of analysis (what is one “row,” conceptually?)
- A realistic path to *one defensible model* by Week 8
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
### **Scoping Principle #2: “Your project should teach you the course”**

This course covers:

- Metrology, uncertainty, and data quality
- Exploratory Data Analysis for messy data
- GLMs → GLMMs → GAMs / GAMMs
- Spatial / temporal heterogeneity
- Model comparison (AIC)
- Prediction and validation
- Structural causal modeling (conceptual level; DAGs)
- Writing results with restraint (defensible claims)

A strong project doesn’t need to use *every* tool — but it should naturally connect to **several** of them. Ideally, your project has at least *one* “real” complication that forces you to think like a scientist:

- non-independence (repeated measures; clustered sampling)
- zeros (many true zeros or detection problems)
- unequal effort / detectability issues
- seasonality or temporal structure
- spatial clustering / site heterogeneity
- measurement uncertainty or instrument drift

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## **Scoping Principle #3: Use this to build an reusable infrastructure**

The biggest hidden benefit of a good scope is that it rewards you for building a clean workflow early:

- clear folder structure
- reproducible Quarto document(s)
- a lightweight data dictionary
- stable variable names and units
- AI interaction logging for troubleshooting and drift tracking

If your project is well-scoped, each improvement you make in Week 2–4 pays dividends in Weeks 7–15.

## **Scoping Principle #4: pick something that advances your degree**

If possible, choose a dataset that:

- is from your lab, thesis, dissertation, or a collaborator
- connects to a real paper/report you *could* write
- has a real audience beyond this course (advisor, lab group, agency, etc.)

Even if the final product is “only” a course draft, you want it to be a **useful artifact** you can revise later.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse=true}
## **Scoping Principle #5: be honest about what you have right now**

A project is not “good” because it is fascinating; it is good because you can **answer something** with the data you actually possess.

Before committing, you should be able to answer:

- Do I have the dataset _in-hand_ by Week 2?
- Does the dataset need cleaning, and can this be done by Weeks 2-3?
- Are the key variables already measured?
- Can I explain each variable’s meaning and units by Week 4?
- Is the sampling design understandable enough to model by Week 7?
- Can I reasonably lock a core model by Week 8?

If the answer is _no_ to any of these, you can still proceed, but you must scope down to what is truly feasible.
:::

## A practical scoping checklist (student-friendly)

Choose a project that meets most of these (given your current knowledge):

- **One question:** you can state clearly in plain language  
- **One primary response:** that matches the question  
- **A known sampling structure:** (site / individual / time / observer, etc.)  
- **A plausible model family:** (GLM / GLMM / GAM / GAMM) you can defend  
- **One major complication:** you can address explicitly (zeros, clustering, etc.)  
- **A results story you can tell honestly:** without over-claiming  
- **A dataset you can understand and trust:** enough to write Methods  

## Examples of good vs. bad scope

Below are examples you can use as patterns. These are **collapsed** so you can skim quickly.

**Project title (working):**  
Canopy structure and bird counts in repeated point counts

**Central question (plain language):**  
Does canopy cover predict bird counts per visit, after accounting for site-to-site variation?

**Data/design clarity:**  
- 30 sites, 4 visits per site  
- Response: count per visit  
- Predictors: canopy cover, wind, observer  
- Grouping: site (random intercept)

**Complication (one is enough):**  
- detection likely declines with canopy and wind  
- repeated measures → non-independence

**Why this is well-scoped:**  
- runnable GLMM by Week 7  
- lockable model by Week 8  
- meaningful uncertainty-aware interpretation by Week 12  
- produces a clean Results section by Week 14

**What you *don’t* try to do:**  
- no “global biodiversity mechanisms”  
- no causal claims without design support  
- no multi-species hierarchy unless truly necessary

**Project title (vague):**  
What drives biodiversity in tropical forests?

**Central question (problem):**  
Too broad to be answerable in one semester

**Data/design issues:**  
- response variable not defined  
- sampling design unclear (“multiple sites and years”)  
- predictors not specified  
- unit of analysis unknown (plot? site? species? time?)

**Complications (too many, unbounded):**  
- spatial structure + temporal trends + detection + species turnover  
- multiple outcomes (richness + abundance + composition + traits)

**Why this scope probably fails:**  
- you cannot write Methods early  
- Week 4 becomes endless data wrangling  
- Week 7 has no runnable model (or 10 models with no rubric)  
- Week 8 “lock” is impossible  
- Results become unfocused and hard to defend

**What this needs to become viable:**  
- choose one response, one scale, one question, and one model family

## “Scope down” moves that work (and feel good)

If your idea is too big, these moves are almost always helpful (but we can talk about what is best for your particular goals):

- **Pick one response variable** (one outcome, not five)
- **Choose one spatial scale** (plots *or* sites, not a whole hierarchy)
- **Choose one time window** (e.g., one season or one year)
- **Start with one model family** (GLMM *or* GAMM — justify later)
- **Limit the predictor set** to a small set you can defend
- **Treat extra complexity as a sensitivity check**, not the core project

## A final recommendation: choose the project you’ll revisit after the course

Pick something you would be proud to show:

- your advisor
- your lab group
- a collaborator
- a future committee member
- your future self

If you choose well, ZOO/ECOL-5500 will not simply teach methods; it will produce a real, useful product that helps you in the future.
