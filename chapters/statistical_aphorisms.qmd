## Three Statistical Aphorisms (to guide you through this course)

::: callout-note
### Aphorism 1: Embrace imperfection

Beware perfection. In data analysis, one can be paralyzed by "perfect" solutions. After all, perfection is a moving target. What does "perfection" really mean in practice? Does it mean that an analysis looks complex enough to impress your colleagues or instructors, even if it's not appropriate for your questions? Is it an analysis that works flawlessly the first time, right out of the box? Or is it one that is quickly built and deployed but that also may hide critical assumptions or produce error-filled predictions? Or perhaps one that a senior colleague or advisor has deemed "the correct" approach (without justification)?

The danger lies in waiting for an ideal solution that may never arrive, or may arrive too late. In doing so, your and your collaborators' progress stalls, opportunities are missed, and, perhaps most importantly, learning is sorely delayed. This idea is captured poetically in the words of Robert Watson-Watt, the inventor of radar:

> ***Give them the third best to go on with; the second best comes too late, the best never comes.***

Watson-Watt’s advice should remind us that, in dynamic and complex fields such as radar development or our own messy statistical modeling, timely action often outweighs our vision of perfection. A solution that is simply good enough today allows you to:

-   **Learn through deployment:** Practical application often reveals insights that you cannot anticipate.
-   **Iterate and improve:** Real-world feedback reveals issues far faster than endless refinement in isolation!
-   **Transparently communicate analytical limitations:** Collaborators and stakeholders can better understand assumptions, uncertainties, and the scope of your work.

In short (as as you know), perfection is often the enemy of good progress. By consciously and purposefully adopting a culture of imperfection, you will be able to better learn, iterate, and produce work that is timely, practical, and ultimately more impactful.

## Analytical Workflow

## Defining "analytical workflow"

What do we mean by analytical workflow? First, it is the data infrastructure that supports efficient analysis. It turns raw data into action.

There should also be analysis of the workflow itself. Is it efficient in terms of computational load or time? Does it allow for reproducibility?

## Two thoughts as you develop your analytical workflow

***Here's my wisdom for your use, as I learned it when the moose And the reindeer roamed where Paris roars to-night: "There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, And—every—single—one—of—them—is—right!*** --From In the Neolithic Age (Rudyard Kipling)

a core tenet of collaborative, creative, and productive data science Let me that for you How many of you have experience with prompt engineering? Your goals as a scientist… Use this course to develop your own philosophical workflow (that reduces bias) Stick to this philosophy until you learn something new and improved

## Statistical Philosophy

More than anything else, I want you to use this course to develop a **personal statistical philosophy**.

A good philosophy: - reduces bias\
- prevents analytical wandering\
- promotes clarity and efficiency\
- evolves as you learn more

I will present a set of guiding principles and aphorisms early in the course. You should modify them, reject them, or replace them—but you should have *something* guiding your decisions.

This is how you become consistent, thoughtful, and credible as a scientist.
