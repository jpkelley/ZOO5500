This means that there are more perspectives to help guide us through the following phases of data analysis:\nThe complexity of the project, difficulty of field conditions, or an impending deadline can make the jumps from data collection to inference horribly daunting to young and old researchers alike. Our joint goal in this course is to become more comfortable with each of these steps, so that we not only work more efficiently but we also know a bit more about how to sense of our complex world. It is my sincerest hope that this course will not only teach you some about statistics (and some statistical traps) but that it will also give you a unique opportunity to work with your peers as you delve into the myriad issues that inevitably arise in data analysis. Working together means that we must first acknowledge that each one of us assimilates new material and produces syntheses in varied ways. All I ask is that each of you",

You should be on your way to developing a habit of translating real-world ecological questions into quantitative frameworks, while explicitly acknowledging uncertainty and bias in estimation and measurement.\nDistinguish between questions/hypotheses, data, and inferences. You should be able to (1) clearly separate ecological hypotheses, the data actually collected, and the quantities being estimated, and (2) understand why these distinctions matter for interpretation and decision-making.\nUnderstand the processes that generate data. You should be able to recognize how different study designs, variation in detection, observer effects, instrument error, and data processing shape and constrain the structure of ecological datasets.\nSelect, build, and critique statistical models as scientific tools. You should be comfortable choosing and using statistical models not as black boxes, but as explicit representations of assumptions about ecological processes, variation, and causal structure. You should never blindly choose a statistical model again!\nInterpret results in ecological —not just statistical— terms. You should be able to conceptually move beyond p-values and coefficients to clearly articulate what your results mean biologically, mechanistically, and practically.\nBe comfortable applying causal –and not just correlational– reasoning. You should be able to use causal thinking (conceptual models and directed acyclic graphs) to evaluate what can —and ehat cannot— be inferred from observational and experimental data.\nCommunicate quantitative results clearly, transparently, and honestl.y Present analyses, figures, and conclusions in ways that are transparent, reproducible, and appropriate for scientific audiences.\nDevelop durable, reproducible analytical workflows. You should be increasingly comfortable with good data-science practices that support clarity, versioning (even though we will not delve into GitHub this term), and reusability of analyses.\nDevelop new confidence working with unfamiliar, complex, imperfect datasets. You should leave this course better prepared to engage with real ecological data —without expecting it to be clean, complete, or simple.",

    "section": "2.3 What is new this term (Spring 2026)?",
    "text": "2.3 What is new this term (Spring 2026)?\nFor Spring 2026, I have added attention to new topics that improve both efficiency of analysis workflows and our ability to understand causality at a deeper level. Specifically, I have chosen to add course components on:\n\nUsing large-language models (LLMs) –via ChatGPT– to improve analytical workflows. This term, I have integrated ChatGPT into the course as a way to support the process of analysis rather than to automate the analysis itself. Many of the hardest parts of quantitative work happen outside of writing code: figuring out why R code isn’t behaving as expected, checking whether an interpretation actually follows from a model, troubleshooting an obscure error message, or getting feedback on how tp clearly document a decision. Used carefully, ChatGPT can act like a sounding board for troubleshooting, sanity-checking, and refining explanations without taking over your critical thinking. Throughout the course, I have deliberately constrained ChatGPT’s role and scope and have tailored its guardrails to match the course progression. In other words, ChatGPT is used to help improve analytical workflow and decision-making, not to generate results or write code on a student’s behalf. We will work together to assess the utility of this tool as the term advances.\n\n\n\n\nUsing large-language models (LLMs) to improve teaching at scale. What does this mean? In past terms, between 10-15 students have been enrolled in this course. This term, I have allowed 26 students to enroll. Without a Teaching Assistant, this spawns a significant issue of scale. This is solvable if we use AI as a helpful tool. So, after spending some time as an LLM-consultant and tester, I decided to explicitly integrate chatGPT’s LLMs into my teaching/grading workflow. This means that students will use a custom GPT that I created specifically for ZOO/ECOL-5500 called JackalopeGPT (using ChatGPT) to run checks on their work prior to submission; this will solve some of the “tuning” issues (with codes, grammar, clarity, etc.) that I have seen in student submissions in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) I added Structural Causal Models (SCMs) at the end of the course to give us a way to think more clearly about complex systems where multiple variables influence each other at the same time. In the first part of the course, students will see the limits of fitting separate models (e.g. GLMs, GLMMs, GAMMs) for singular response variables; those models can work individually, but they often miss shared drivers, indirect effects, or how pieces of the complex system of exogenous and endogenous factors fit together. SCMs give us a way to lay out those relationships explicitly and analyze them as a connected structure (as is present in natural systems) rather than as a collection of isolated models. The goal isn’t to replace the modeling approaches we’ve already used but to improve inference by making our assumptions about the system clear and coherent.\nJackalopes! This course corrects a long-standing perspective that (1) jackalopes had deer-like antlers (Fig. 1), and (2) there was only a single species of jackalopes (Fig. 2). We will use the newly discovered cryptid ecosystem for course exercises and examples.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Illustrations of the correct and incorrect ornament morphology of jackalopes.",

You do not have to go through the experience alone. For example, if you inform us of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination we will keep the information as private as we can, but we am required to bring it to the attention of the institution’s Title IX Coordinator. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, you can contact Equal Opportunity Report and Response (Bureau of Mines Room 319, 766-5200, report-it@uwyo.edu, www.uwyo.edu/reportit).

    "text": "5.2 Purpose\nThis document reviews principles, guard rails, and documentation practices for the responsible use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in scientific research and analysis. One such GenAI tool that most of us are familiar with is ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a GenAI model that can detect (and arguably understand) and generate human-like text by predicting what comes next in a sentence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are very advanced GenAI systems trained on absolutely massive amounts of text to answer complex questions, write in certain rhetorical tones, summarize information, or have conversations in natural language. Given this tool’s widespread utility, it can certainly be misused. Therefore, the guidelines below attempt to ensure that GenAI augments human reasoning without compromising scientific validity, reproducibility, or accountability. In all aspects of the present academic work, GenAI tools like ChatGPT are therefore treated as assistive tools –comparable to statistical software (like R) or calculators– not as autonomous analysts or skilled authors.",

    "text": "5.3 Core principles of responsible use of GenAI\n\nAccountability: The human researcher retains full responsibility for –and is held accountable for– all analytical decisions, interpretations, text and code, and inference. The use of GenAI does not relieve any burdens of authorship, responsibility, or liability. Importantly, this means that the human researcher is allowed –and, in most cases, is encouraged– to use AI-produced code, as long as the research has vetted and error-checked. This likewise assumes that the researcher accepts responsibility for any and all errors arising from AI assistance. That is, GenAI may accelerate work, but it may not replace understanding. If a researcher cannot defend a decision without the GenAI present, the decision is invalid.\nScientific Primacy: Scientific reasoning precedes and constrains GenAI use. Hypotheses, data-generating assumptions, and model structures must be defined by the researcher. GenAI may clarify or critique these decisions but may not create them from scratch without human justification.\nTransparency: All GenAI use must be documented in a way that allows another scientist to understand how GenAI influenced the work. GenAI-assisted reasoning must be distinguishable from original analysis.\nReproducibility: All results must be reproducible without access to GenAI tools. Data, code, and associated documentation must be sufficient to reproduce results independently. GenAI may assist development but must not be a hidden dependency.\nProportionality: The level of documentation naturally should be proportional to the influence of GenAI. Minor stylistic assistance requires minimal logging, while conceptual or analytical assistance requires a larger volume of explicit documentation and justification.",

AI absolutely must not invent methods, results, or citations.\nCode Understanding: GenAI may explain what existing code does, diagnose warnings or errors conceptually, and suggest stylistic or reproducibility improvements. AI may not replace independent code comprehension.\n\n\n\n\nProhibited or Restricted Uses of GenAIin Scientific Work\n\nReplacement of Scientific Judgment: GenAI must not be used to select models, error distributions, priors, or random-effects structures without independent human justification, nor to interpret results without verification.\nUndocumented Analysis Generation: GenAI must not generate full end-to-end analytical pipelines without explanation, or produce black-box code whose logic is not understood by the researcher.\nFabrication: GenAI must not be used to invent data, methods, results, or citations, or to create post-hoc justifications unsupported by the analysis.\nOutcome Optimization: GenAI must not be used to iteratively prompt for statistically significant results, improved AIC values, or exaggerated certainty.",

(This is a required component for students in ZOO/ECOL-5500 starting Spring 2026)\n\nRequired Information: Entries record the date, GenAI tool used, purpose of interaction, nature of assistance provided, key takeaway, and the verification step performed.\nWhen Logging Is Required: Logging is required when GenAI influences model choice, interpretation, methodological justification, or scientific claims. Minor stylistic or grammatical use does not require detailed logging.\nVerification Obligations: Any GenAI-suggested content must be independently verified using primary literature, software documentation, diagnostic checks, or independent reasoning. Unverified AI output must not appear in final analyses.\nAuthorship and Attribution: GenAI tools are not authors and do not receive citation credit. If required by journals or funders, GenAI use may be acknowledged in a neutral Methods or Acknowledgments statement.\nEthical Safeguards: GenAI use must not obscure uncertainty, inflate confidence, reduce methodological transparency, or disadvantage collaborators or students with limited access to AI tools.",

    "text": "Join the ZOO-5500 Slack (private link sent via email)\nDownload, Install, and set up RStudio Desktop\nGather your dataset files for your analysis\n\n\n6.1.1 Join the ZOO-5500 Slack\nJust click on the list and follow instructions. We will use Slack to encourage ongoing, low-stakes discussion within the class. This will be for sharing questions, ideas, and insights in real time so that learning can continue outside of scheduled class meetings. This allows everyone (even me) to get answers to questions that I might be thinking about at odd times. It also allows for problems to be solved faster; rather than waiting until our synchronous Zoom session to ask about an issue, we can group-think over the course of the week. Remember that this is set up to improve collaboration; it does not mean that anyone should be responding outside of work hours or on the weekends. Below are the preferred channels for different kinds of communication:\n\n#announcements &gt;Read-only channel for important course information like deadlines, corrections, and post-class clarifications. Check this regularly.\n#course-questions &gt;For general course or assignment questions (due dates, unclear wording on websites) that others might also have. Expect peer responses and occasional instructor follow-ups.\n#data-help &gt;For data wrangling and technical data issues (imports, joins, NAs, plots). Not for model choice or interpretation.\n#model-talk &gt;For conceptual questions about models and assumptions. Discussion-focused; no code debugging.\n#analysis-workflow &gt;For questions about reproducibility, organization, reporting, and good analytical habits.\n#ai-use-and-logs For discussing allowed AI use and posting AI interaction logs when requested. No private communication or graded work.\n#papers-good-bad-ugly &gt;For highlighting examples of good and bad analyses in published work.\n#random &gt;For off-topic chat, random links, and fun stuff. This will help keep everything else focused.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Download, Install, and set up RStudio Desktop\nInstall on your local machine. All coding and file organization will be done in RStudio. Note that the following is a very basic way of creating a set of project folders. You will see boxes with R code. Feel free to copy and run these, if necessary. Here are the basic steps:\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop. Navigate to your folder (in this case, your student folder).\nIn “Files” window (lower right panel in RStudio), click “More/Set as Working Directory”. This sets your working directory; this is always a good idea to do.\nCreate a New R Project in your student folder: “File/New Project/Existing Directory”. Name this project appropriately.\nCreate your File structure: Refer to this RStudio tutorial. In this class, we will modify this set of directories to make things a bit easier and more transparent for you. After completing the following steps, place your dataset in your “data/raw_data” folder (after you create it below). Navigate to this folder on your computer and drag-and-drop or copy-paste your data file(s) into this folder.\n\nCreate three folders (one suggested framework):\n\n/data (for raw, processed, clean datasets)\n/r_scripts (for R scripts, each containing a set of related functions)\n/output output (for models, graphs, tables)\n\nWe can do this by staying in our directory (within RStudio) and then using the dir.create function.\n\ndir.create(\"data\")\n\nYou can see your new folder (“data”) appear in the Files in the lower right window within RStudio. Now let’s create the other two folders.\n\ndir.create(\"r_scripts\")\ndir.create(\"output\")\n\nTo help with data processing (i.e. cleaning and organization)–something that we will discuss in coming days within the context of your analytical workflow–, we will create some subfolders within your newly created “data” folder. Let’s do this now. Note how you create a folder within the “data” folder by specifying the path:\n\ndir.create(\"data/raw_data\")\ndir.create(\"data/processed_data\")\ndir.create(\"data/metadata\")\n\nAnd that is how you create a basic R Project in RStudio! What you have done is create a set of folders and subfolders that have names that can be easily understood by other users. Feel free to create other subfolders now. Or, should you not like the file nomenclature used above, change the names to whatever you wish. Just be sure that this structure is as simple as possible so that other users understand what you have done.\nThere is an added benefit to creating an R Project in this way. What you have done is create a minimally reproducible data structure. There are two primary ways this can be accomplished (if you are not familiar with this. First method: A collaborator (or instructor or classmate) can simply navigate to your subfolder, set that as their working directory from within RStudio, and then open the .RProj file. Alternatively, you can create zip your root folder (the one labelled as your name, in this case) and then share your entire analysis, etc. All the recipient would need to do is unzip the folder, open the .Rproj file, and then “Set as Working Directory.”\n\n\n6.1.3 Gather your dataset files for your analysis\nPlace your data in your “data/raw_data” subfolder and then confirm that your files are present by running the list.files function.\n\nlist.files(\"data/raw_data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWorking order means more than a spreadsheet or two.\nA dataset is only complete if it includes metadata. Metadata describe: - what the variables are\n- how the data were collected\n- under what conditions\n- with what assumptions and limitations\nIf you have questions about metadata, I have an old, dedicated lecture on metadata structures, and I strongly encourage you to reach out.\n\n\nYou are now ready to move to the next steps of loading necessary R packages and beginning your journey of data exploration!",

The scale’s primary benefits include:\n\nIt is easy to read. The traffic light color scheme (green, yellow, and red) tell you right away whether your work is ready to move forward, needs some fixing, or needs a more substantial rethink (the majority of good scientists’ ideas)\nIt is the same for every assignment. I use this scale for all milestone assignments. Therefore, the standards are predictable for every assignment.\nIt centers on scientific readiness, not scientific perfection (which, technically, does not exist). You are not being graded on having the “right” answer. What matters most to me is whether your question, data, and reasoning co-exist coherently together.\nIt matches how real science works. Research almost never gets it right on the first try; drafts, checks, and revisions are normal.\nIt allows for rapid feedback. GenAI will do some of the busy work associated with troubleshooting coding issues or improving clarity, which will give me more time to gauge the scientific readiness of your work.

    "text": "9.1.1 What are Large Language Models (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)\nJackalopeGPT is a customized GPT assistant tailored specifically for this course using OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM). Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are advanced generative artifical intelligence systems trained on absolutely massive collections of text, enabling them to answer complex questions, summarize information, write in particular styles, and interact using natural language. Large Language Models are trained in two distinct steps that intentionally put humans in the loop:\n\nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT) teaches the model what to say by training on human-written input–output examples.\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) teaches the model how to say it by rewarding outputs people judge as better (clearer, safer, more helpful, etc.).\n\nThe key takeaway is very practical for our purposes in this course: these models are optimized for interaction (between the user and LLM). The trade-off is that they are not necessarily built for accuracy. Model responses to users’ prompts (see Section 8.1.2) can sound amazingly confident and authoritative even when their information is grossly incorrect.\n\n\n9.1.2 What are prompts?\nAs stated above, you begin each interaction with an LLM using a prompt. A prompt is simply your input to the trained model; it is your question or request. There are two broad classes of prompts that are operationally differentiated by their purpose:\n\nEvaluative prompts: Models that produce content (e.g., text, code, summaries, or ideas).\nGenerative prompts: Models that assess or critique ingested data.\n\nIn this course, your goal for JackalopeGPT is not to “get an answer,” so we primarily use evaluative prompts. This prompting type keeps you in control of important scientific decisions and constrains the model’s role to that of a friendly reviewer or sounding board (rather than an autonomous data scientist).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGood prompt engineering takes practice\n\n\n\nPlease note that it may take a bit of practice to concisely write prompts that contain all of this information and yield high-quality responses, but this is a good framework to get you started.",

    "text": "9.2 Engineering Successful Prompts\n\n9.2.1 The iterative prompting loop\nSuccessful prompting is usually iterative, involving the following basic steps:\n\nState expectations clearly. Your goal is to produce an output you can evaluate.\nEvaluate the response using a documented rubric. You should always have an implicit (or explicit) rubric in mind: a short set of criteria that defines what a good response should contain.\nRevise the prompt to reduce ambiguity and increase verifiability. Use the rubric to improve the prompt by clarifying the task/topic/context, adding constraints, and requiring formal checks so the response is easier to evaluate.\nRepeat (briefly, yet thoughtfully). until the output is actionable.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Why good prompting matters (and why you should verify outputs)\nLarge Language Models can be extremely helpful, but they are not a scientific authority, and its responses are not “timeless.” That is, the quality of the responses depends heavily on what you ask and when you ask it (given what information has been recently folded into the LLM training).\n\n\n9.2.3 Actions for writing strong prompts\n\nLeverage your expertise: Use your biological knowledge to define what matters: structure of your study design, sources of bias (detectability of individuals), confounding variables, scale, or non-independence.\nBe challenging and specific. Remove the escape routes. Provide the response type, design, predictors, and what you want back (models, diagnostics, interpretation template).\nUse explicit constraints: Tell it how to answer (format, scope, evidence requirements), not just what to answer.\nForce juggling: Require it to handle multiple issues at once (e.g., zero inflation + nesting + spatial clustering).\nKeep it realistic: Ask for defensible inference, not magic. Explicitly ask it to flag overreach.\nMake prompts reusable: Favor principles and reasoning over tool/version-specific instructions (unless needed).\nMake prompts unambiguous and evaluable: Avoid “this/that/the above” references that only make sense outside the current chat.\nAvoid broad prompts; make outputs verifiable. Interaction GPTs love to spread their wings when given some wiggle room.\nWrite original prompts. Writing original prompts grounds the model in how you think about a scientific question. The model can help refine language or suggest options, but it should not invent the prompt’s goals.\n\n\n\n\n9.2.4 TRACE: a framework for writing strong prompts\nUse TRACE as a memory hook (technically, a acronymic mnemonic) for what to include in high-quality, repeatable prompts:\n\nT (Task/Topic, aka Context): What problem are you working on? What’s the data/design?\nR (Role): What kind of helper should JackalopeGPT be?\nA (Audience): What level should it explain to?\nC (Criteria): What must a good answer include?\nE (Exclusions): What should it avoid? What is out-of-scope?\n\nHere is a more detailed description. The bracketed, italicized components indicate places where you enter your original prompt components. Examples are given in the Description column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\nComponent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nT\nTask / Topic\nI am working on: [system + response + sampling design + sample sizes]. Known issues: [zeros / detectability / spatial clustering / non-independence / confounding].   Example: I have repeated point counts at 30 sites (4 visits per site). The response variable is bird counts per visit. Predictors include canopy density, wind, and observer. I expect detection of individuals to decline as a function of canopy density and wind.\n\n\nR\nRole\nAct as a [R tutor / methods advisor / model debugger].   Example: Act as an ecology methods advisor and R tutor.\n\n\nA\nAudience\nExplain to a [specified knowledge level].   Example: Explain to a 1st–2nd year ecology graduate student with basic statistics knowledge, who has 5–6 months’ experience working with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in R.\n\n\nC\nCriteria\nA good answer must include: [(1) restate the design, (2) assumptions, (3) 2–3 candidate approaches, (4) diagnostics and checks, (5) interpretation limits and what would change the recommendation.]   Example: Propose two scientifically defensible modeling approaches. For each, state assumptions, specify the model structure (in words or formula), list at least two scientifically defensible model diagnostics, and explain what result would be misleading if detection bias is not accounted for.\n\n\nE\nExclusions\nDo not: [write my full assignment / invent data / claim causality / skip assumptions / provide code if concepts only were requested].   Example: Do not claim causal effects. Do not invent data. Do not write end-to-end analysis code. If information is missing, list what is needed rather than guessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTRACE templates for your convenience\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Sheet template (Read-only; you can copy and paste)\nGoogle Doc template (Read-only; you can copy and paste)",

    "section": "9.3 Evaluating LLM Output",
    "text": "9.3 Evaluating LLM Output\n\n9.3.1 The Rubric-Prompt Synergy\nA rubric is your short checklist for what a complete and accurate response must include. Do not skip it or underestimate its utility: LLMs can sound confident while being downright wrong and incomplete. A good rubric –derived from your own expertise– is how you keep yourself in control of the LLM’s behavior.\nThink of your prompt as a cake recipe and the rubric as the taste test. (I am already thinking this analogy isn’t worth its salt.) The cake might look finished and ready to bring to the party, but the rubric if what tells you whether the cake is actually edible. In other words, you and your rubric must:\n\nNOT ask “Is this answer impressive and sounds smart?”\n\nDefinitely ask “Is this answer complete, appropriately constrained, and testable or verifiable?”\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Rubric criteria\nAfter developing and running a conceptually good prompt, you can be satisfied that a response is worth using if it satisfies the following criteria:\n\nGets the problem right\n\nStates its assumptions\n\nExplains its reasoning\n\nShows how to check itself\n\nKnows where it could be wrong\n\nIf any one of these is missing, revise the prompt before revising your analysis. To see details about each of the above criteria, click on the green box below to expand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDetailed criteria for assessing LLM responses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it get the problem right?\n\nCheck whether the response correctly restates your system, data, and task.\nLook for invented details or a mischaracterized study design.\nIf this fails, stop and revise the prompt (not your interpretation).\n\n\n\n\nDoes it state its assumptions?\n\nIdentify whether assumptions are explicit (e.g., independence, sampling, detection, distributional form, causal limits).\nMissing or vague assumptions make recommendations hard to evaluate.\nTreat missing assumptions as a prompt failure, not a model error.\n\n\n\n\nDoes it explain its reasoning?\n\nLook for a clear, step-by-step chain from design → model → inference.\nExplanations should justify why recommendations follow from the setup.\nWithout step-by-step reasoning, we cannot evaluate conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nIs it verifiable?\n\nThe response should include at least one diagnostic, stress test, or sensitivity check (which we will discuss later in the course)\nIt should explain how the recommendation could fail or mislead.\nAdvice without checks is not trustworthy.\n\n\n\n\nDoes it know where it could be wrong?\n\nCheck for limits: what cannot be concluded, what would be overreach, what remains uncertain.\nLook for acknowledgment of uncertainty.\nOverconfidence is a severe red flag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Quantifying Model Drift: Another way to put rubrics to work\nLarge Language Models are updated and adjusted over time. That means the same prompt can yield different answers across weeks or months—sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically. To stay scientifically grounded, you need a habit of validation, a way to detect when the LLM’s behavior has changed and when outputs should no longer be trusted. Consider the following scenario. Imagine you weigh your study subjects on a scale every morning. A lab jackanape recalibrates the scale every few weeks without telling you. After discovering that this has occurred, would you trust that the measurements are directly comparable across time? However, if your lab protocol included a daily measurement of a standardized set of weights, you could determine exactly when recalibrations were back, and, what’s even better, you could adjust your measurements accordingly. Science would be saved!\n\nA practical –and easy– way to assess “model drift” in your own work\n\nKeep 3–5 benchmark prompts you reuse all semester (e.g., “fit a GLMM with random intercept for site, explain assumptions, propose diagnostics”). Ideally, you should document and store these as metadata, so that the phrase(s) can always be connected to a project and also be easily accessed.\nRe-run the same benchmark prompt occasionally (at a predefined interval or whenever you begin a new interaction or project). Save (copy/paste) the prompt + output into your AI Interaction Log.\nExamine the output for changes in:\n\nwhether it correctly restates the design,\nwhether it flags assumptions and/or constraints,\nwhether it proposes diagnostics that are scientifically defensible,\nwhether it starts inventing details or over-claiming.\n[other criteria that you can think of?]",

I’m a beginner–intermediate R user. I’m fitting a GLMM for counts with a random intercept for site. Here is my code and the exact error message:. A good answer must: (1) identify the likely cause, (2) show the minimal fix, (3) explain why it failed, (4) suggest one diagnostic check. Do not rewrite my entire analysis—just fix the error and explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Example 2: Choosing a model strategy (polished but incomplete)\n\n“I have ecological count data collected over multiple sites and years, and I want to choose an appropriate statistical model that accounts for structure in the data. Can you recommend a suitable modeling approach and explain why?”\n\nThis prompt sounds careful and scientific, but it fails to bound the answer and require checks, inviting a vague or overbroad response.

Compare 2–3 modeling strategies (e.g., negative binomial GLMM vs zero-inflated vs hurdle), state assumptions, and give diagnostics that would falsify each. Do not claim causality; focus on defensible inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Example 3: Interpreting a model result\n\n“How do I interpret this coefficient?”\n\nThis is another example of a prompt that is vague even by the standards of a simple web search.

Do not claim causal effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Example 4: Checking model assumptions\n\n“I’m using a Poisson mixed-effects model for count data with repeated measurements across sites. Can you explain the assumptions of this model and whether it’s appropriate for my analysis?”\n\nThis prompt is very polished but incomplete as it lacks a set of criteria for which a good answer must include.

Establishing a clear, reproducible workflow creates a solid foundation that can scale appropriately as new data arrive –whether that means new sensor downloads, ongoing field observations, or ever-expanding datasets– without requiring you to constantly restructure, reinvent, or debug your analysis.\nThis chapter provides the broad conceptual map for the rest of Part I. Subsequent chapters focus on individual components of this workflow.\nEverything up to (and including) production of figures and tables can and should be reproducible. That is, (1) you should be able to rerun an entire analysis and produce tables and figures (and fill in values in a Results section) with a simple click of a button, and (2) another user should be able to reproduce all steps in your analysis pipeline, even with minimal code. Framing the workflow as a casual path makes obvious how each result is causally linked to specific inputs, transformations, and assumptions.",

    "text": "11.2 Analytical Workflow\nA statistical philosophy only works if it is supported by a deliberate, reproducible analytical workflow. This workflow description is doing a lot of work, so let us be very clear about the meaning.\n\nAnalytical workflow: The data and computational infrastructure that translates raw observations into scientifically defensible results and inferences.\n\nA workflow include everything about how datasets are stored, cleaned, explored, modeled, and reported. Importantly, it also includes how decisions are documented and how analyses can be reproduced by someone else (including your future, more frenetic self).\nDesigning a good analytical workflow is hardly a casual endeavor. In fact, it should be a target of formal and toughtful analysis itself, answering questions like:\n\nIs your workflow efficient in terms of your valuable time?\nIs your workflow efficient in terms of your computational infrastucture and abilities?\nIs your workflow clear, or does it create confusion and induce mission/scope creep?\nDoes your workflow allow you to stop and restart without losing your place?\n\nA good workflow constrains your behavior in productive ways. It limits wandering, enforces transparency, and makes progress visible. That is, there is no single correct workflow. As Rudyard Kipling wrote (In the Neolithic Age):\n\nHere’s my wisdom for your use, as I learned it when the moose And the reindeer roamed where Paris roars to-night: “There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, And—every—single—one—of—them—is—right!\n\nThere are many ways of constructing something useful and meaningful, and every single one of them can be right. What matters is that your workflow is intentional, scientifically defensible, and aligned with your scientific goals. So, I encourage you to start formalizing a philosophical workflow that reduces bias, controls scope, and supports efficient thinking. Then stick to it until you learn something better. That moment will come, and when it does, simply update your philosophy through slow iteration rather than abandoning it.",

Generally, this pipeline looks like this:\n\nWorld → Data → Models → Inference → Interpretation\n\nMore explicitly, as seen in the diagram at right, we have the following general steps:\n\nWorld / phenomena: Processes exist whether or not we observe them (or like them!)\nMeasurement & observation: Instruments and observers translate phenomena into recorded values.\nRaw data + metadata: Raw data must have metadata as context.\nProcessing & derivation: Filtering, organizing, feature extraction, etc.\nModels & inference rules: Assumptions can be documented and coded explicitly.\nInterpretation: Human judgment (which is usually not reproducible, unless codified).",

    "text": "11.5 Why workflows matter scientifically\nReproducibility in a scientific workflow is not primarily about convenience, though it often becomes convenient over time. A convenient –but non-reproducible– workflow focuses on rerunning an analysis quickly, often relying on memory, manual steps, and undocumented choices. That approach may work in the short term, but it does not scale and rarely holds up weeks, months, or years later. A reproducible workflow, by contrast, is designed so that every result can be traced back to its origins, including the data, code, assumptions, and decisions that produced it.\nAt a broader scale, reproducible workflows allow us to:\n\ndiagnose errors\nunderstand sensitivity to assumptions\nreuse data responsibly\nbuild on previous work without re-guessing decisions\nreduce long-term computational and cognitive overhead\n\nIn short:\n\nConvenience: “Can I run this analysis again?”\nReproducibility: “Can I clearly show how these results were produced?”",

Whereas it has traditionally focused on the physical sciences and engineered systems, it applies just as much to biology and its messier subfields (e.g. ecology) as it does to physics or chemistry.\nMetrology establishes a formal framework for ensuring that scientific measurements are traceable to standards, reported with uncertainty, and reproducible across space, time, and observers. Crucially, this framework operates upstream of analysis—at the moment when information about the world are collected an raw data are generated. Metrology naturally integrates with our discussion of reproducible analyses because, instead of a number standing alone, a measurement comes bundled with information about what it was trying to measure, how reliable it is, and what assumptions were made along the way. That lets future researchers decide whether datasets are truly comparable, whether old data can answer new and exciting questions, and how much trust researchers should place in a result without having to guess what the original researcher meant.\nTwo term must be clearly differentiated from measurements and estimates.

Raw data preserve the closest recorded traces of the measurement process, making it possible to understand how observations relate to the underlying measurand and what estimands the data can actually support.\nBy now, we have all been conducting formal scientific inquiry for many years. It is common to see folders labeled /raw_data/ that contain offloaded sensor files or spreadsheets transcribed from field notebooks. These data may feel “raw,” but often they are not.\n\nRaw data are the facts produced by an instrument or observer through a domain-specific translation, recorded at the time of observation, and preserved without post-hoc modification.\n\n\n\nWhen we offload data from a sensor or transcribe notes into a spreadsheet, our actions have a non-zero probability of influencing the data.\nExamples of raw data include:\n\naudio waveforms recorded at a study site (on the device)\n\nGPS locations logged by a collar (not yet downloaded)\n\ncounts written on a datasheet (not yet transcribed)\n\npixel values collected by a camera sensor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCommon misconceptions about raw data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw data are not clean, tidy, or analysis-ready\n\nProcessed tables and summaries are not raw data\n\nRaw data are not the truth—they are translated observations\n\nRaw data are not limited to numbers\n\nMessiness does not imply poor data quality\n\nEarly processing choices permanently change the data\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw data are the foundation of all scientific analysis. On their own, however, they are incomplete. To be interpretable, reusable, and reproducible, raw data require context.\nThat context comes from metadata, which are introduced on the next page.

    "text": "13.9 Why we use YAML\nTo support that transition from your mind (or Google Sheets), this course adopts YAML as the canonical format for project-level metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteYAML: What’s in a name?\n\n\n\nOriginally, YAML was an abbreviation for “Yet Another Markup Language”. Later, it become “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhat the heck is canonical in this context?\n\n\n\nCanonical simply means that there is exactly one place where your dataset is formally defined; it does not mean that your metadata exists as exactly one file (though it could).\n\n\nThere are several advantages to using YAML, including:\n\nhuman-readable and easy to edit\n\nstructured and explicit about relationships\n\neasy to version-control\n\nsimple to validate and extend (i.e. Quarto markdown files have YAML headers)\n\nstraightforward to convert into repository-specific schemas later\n\nMost importantly, YAML encourages you to think carefully about what varies, what stays constant, and how different pieces of a dataset relate to one another.\nIn the next section, we will walk through the structure of a well-designed YAML metadata file, using concrete examples and expandable templates to show how common research scenarios —such as multiple instruments, deployments, or sampling rates— can be documented clearly and correctly.",

Instead, it functions to reduce bias, prevent analytical wandering, promote clarity, encourage efficiency. Most importantly, a good statistical philosophy evolves with you, as you learn more. I will offer a set of guiding principles and aphorisms early in the course. You should modify them, reject them, or replace them entirely. What matters is that you have something guiding your choices. This is how you become consistent, thoughtful, and credible as a scientist rather than someone who simply runs analyses.\nWhat follows are two components.

    "text": "15.2 Four Statistical Aphorisms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAphorism #1: Accept imperfection\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware perfection. In data analysis, one can be paralyzed by by the moving target of the perfect solution. But what does perfection really mean in practice? Does it mean that an analysis looks complex enough to impress your colleagues or instructors, even if it is does not match the scope or intent of your questions (or, worse yet, is blatantly incorrect)? Is it an analysis that works flawlessly the first time, right out of the box? Or is it one that is quickly built and deployed but also hides critical assumptions or produces error-filled predictions?\nThe danger in seeking statistical (or, more generally, scientific) perfection lies in waiting for an ideal solution that may never arrive, or may arrive too late. In doing so, your and your collaborators’ progress stalls, opportunities are missed, and, perhaps most importantly, learning is sorely delayed. This idea is captured poetically in the words of Robert Watson-Watt, the inventor of radar:\n\nGive them the third best to go on with; the second best comes too late, the best never comes.\n\nWatson-Watt’s advice should remind us that, in dynamic and complex fields such as radar development or our own messy statistical modeling, timely action often outweighs our vision of perfection. A solution that is simply good enough today allows you to:\n\nLearn through deployment: Practical application often reveals insights that you cannot anticipate.\nIterate and improve: Real-world feedback reveals issues far faster than endless refinement in isolation!\nTransparently communicate analytical limitations: Collaborators and stakeholders can better understand assumptions, uncertainties, and the scope of your work.\n\nIn short (as as you know), perfection is often the enemy of good progress. By purposefully embracing imperfection, you will be able to better learn, iterate, and produce work that is timely, practical, and ultimately more impactful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAphorism #2: Embrace complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a reason why my lab is called the Behavioral Complexity Lab. Ecological and biological systems are wonderfully complex, thrillingly messy, and often only partially observed. Pretending that such complexities do not exist does not make your analysis stronger or more robust; it just makes the analysis less honest and transparent. Actively embracing complexity does not mean building the most complicated model you can imagine. It means acknowledging that the process generating your data is rarely simple and that oversimplification might be very costly.\nAt the same time, complexity must be earned. Adding complex model structure, more parameters, or more nested hierarchical layers should be motivated by expert knowledge of biology (at any level) or study design, not by the existence of a published paper, an established method, or a online tutorial. Tis better to manage complexity rather than avoid it (mainly because complexity is all around us). Good analysts learn how to represent complexity in ways that are interpretable, testable, and aligned with the question being asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAphorism #3: Beware of Armadillo Burrows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is based on a real sign I saw on a hiking trail in southern Brazil, and I thought it was a good metaphorical reminder to not fall into someone else’s statistical trap!\nConsider a statistical approach of a senior colleague or advisor that they deem the correct or optimal approach (without justification)? One of the fastest ways to absolutely derail an otherwise good analysis is to blindly inherit and use a statistical framework without understanding why it was chosen in the first place. If you blindly accepted it, what is to say that the previous scientist did not also do the same, ad infinitum? Methods might be copied or carried over from published papers, lab traditions, or online examples without careful thought. Every statistical choice embeds assumptions about scale, error, independence, and causality. When you adopt someone else’s approach wholesale, you also adopt all of their assumptions, whether or not they apply to your data. So, please be cautious.\nThe assignments in this course will repeatedly (ad nauseum) ask you to justify your modeling decisions clearly. And your analysis decisions should align with your question, your data, and your scientific goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAphorism #4: Beware paralysis of analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a point at which conducting more data exploration, running more (and different) models, and sifting through more diagnostics stop improving understanding and start delaying decisions. This is paralysis of analysis, and it is insidious. It often shows up as endless model tweaking, perpetual searching for the perfect model structure, or reluctance to commit to an inferential path (which can lead to never-ending arguments with co-authors),\nA good analytical workflow balances scientific rigor with momentum. Certainly, you may end up with data that are near-perfect and easy to work with. You also may use models that are well-matched to your data constraints without you ever lifting an analytical finger. But this is rare. You should aim for models that are good enough to answer the question at hand, given the data you have, within the constraints you face. This does not mean lowering your standards, especially when faced with looming deadlines. This simply means recognizing diminishing returns and knowing when to move forward.

    "text": "16.1 Introduction\nConsider the following scenario. Being an expert in jackalope analytics, you are asked (by some really awesome colleagues) to analyze a dataset that you have never seen. You meet with your colleagues; they describe the data, their goals, and their timeline; you send a few appropriate follow-up questions. They answer. All seems good. You jump right into analysis. Two weeks (!) into a complex workflow, you discover two small details they “forgot” to mention: (1) half the data are questionable because, unbeknowst to them, a jackalope infiltrated the field crew and collected data for a month, and (2) several samples were contaminated with jackalope saliva.\nBecause you skipped the critical data exploration step, you just injected a suite of bad assumptions into everything downstream. The lesson is oddly simple: take your time and be systematic in data exploration. In this course, the goal is not to rush into running statistical models or jump to drawing strong inference, but rather to catch problems early – before they derail your modeling. Even if you collected the data yourself and feel like you know them inside and out, do not assume that you can or should bypass this critical step. Data Demons have great timing and even greater motivation to see you fail, especially near the end of a project or a degree.\nThis week, we purposefully slow the workflow down and practice exploring datasets so that problems like these show up early –long before they shape your model decisions or waste weeks of work. In the next pages, we will walk through core data exploration steps that should always come before formal modeling.",

It is not a fishing expedition to find interesting aspects of your data.

This is where you actively test assumptions such as:\n\nWhat does one row of the dataset actually represent?\nDoes the nested structure of the data (e.g. number of individuals in each of many sites)\nDo temporal and spatial units align with the research question?\n\nExploration exposes missing or contradictory metadata immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInforming how you design your models\n\n\n\n\n\nData exploration directly constrains your modeling options.

Its purpose is not to fix the data, but rather to identify critical and fatal issues when they are easiest to diagnose and least costly to address. Skipping these steps often leads to confusion or Paralysis of Analysis during modeling. Many of these are mistakes I have made myself over the years…and learned from the hard way.\nThis section focuses on the first three most important tools within this toolkit: assessing potential outliers, assessing potential excess of zero values, and assessing potential information redundancy among covariates. The first section –outliers– will be discussed on its own; for the sake of course timing, the other two will be discussed in the tutorial and later in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipGLMMs and GAMMs: why homogeneity of variance is not required\n\n\n\n\n\nMost ecological data are far more complex than what simple Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or linear model frameworks can handle, often involving non-Gaussian dependent variables, hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data), and uneven sampling. In this context, enforcing homogeneity of variance in the classical sense is not required; in face, it is appropriate.\nIn Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMMs) and Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), variance is explicitly modeled through the choice of error distribution, link function, and hierarchical structure. As a result, heterogeneity of variance on the response scale is not a violation of assumptions; it is often an expected property of the data.\n\nTakeaway: In GLMMs and GAMMs, variance diagnostics evaluate model adequacy, not whether of not the data meet the homoscedasticity assumption a priori. In other words, you can skip that irrelevant section of Zuur et al. (2010).",

Such univariate outliers should never be removed automatically. Their role in ante hoc exploration is to flag observations that deserve closer inspection. So, how can we identify univariate outliers? Univariate outliers can be flagged using two approaches:\n\nStatistical rules: rules depend on assumptions and sample size\n\nExpert judgment: assessment that relies on domain knowledge\n\nBoth approaches have advantages and limitations. Statistical rules can be fragile with small samples, while expert judgment can be applied inconsistently over time and across contexts.\n\n18.5.1 Graphical approaches to univariate outliers\nBefore modeling, graphical inspection provides an extremely valuable first pass at outlier detection. All of these methods are subjective but effective for identifying values that warrant extra scrutiny. Because these myriad approaches essentially allow you to see the same dimensions in your dataset from slightly different perspective, we do not go all of the graphing types. Here are a few useful graphing types for your reference:\n\nCleveland dot plot\nStrip plot\nGeneralized density plot\nHeat map\na myriad others\n\n\n\n18.5.2 Tukey Box Plots\nTukey-style box plots are based on quantiles, not distributional assumptions. Traditional Tukey-style boxplots, which you will find in several R packages, have several core features:\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR), or the difference between the 75% precentile (Q3) and the 25% percentile (Q1):\n\n\\[\n\\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\n\\]\n\nWhiskers extending to \\(1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\\)\nPoints beyond this threshold flagged as outliers\n\nPoints beyond \\(3 \\times \\text{IQR}\\) sometimes flagged as extreme outliers\n\nThese cutoffs are conventional and not inferential. They provide a rule of thumb; they do not provide a statistical test. (You should see a theme: use outlier tests to flag values for extra scrutiny.)\n::: {callout-note collapse=true icon=false} ## Tukey-style boxplots and non-normal data: do not worry! Tukey-style boxplot whiskers are nonparametric; that is, they rely on quantiles (IQR), which are order statistics, and not distributional assumptions. Because outlier flagging at the lower bound is based on ranks, departures from normality are acceptable. :::\n\n\n\n\n18.5.3 Conditional Boxplots\nConditional boxplots extend the univariate, Tukey-style boxplot by stratifying the data by a grouping factor (e.g., site, treatment, time). These plots are especially useful for diagnosing heterogeneity across groups and identifying where flagged values originate. At first, the simplicity of these plots may give the impression that they are not useful, but you will quickly find that piecing together many of these visualizations can help uncover subtle issues with your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional boxplot allowing the user to visualize potential extreme values within specific groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.5.4 Warnings about detecting univariate outliers from visual inspection\nRules of outlier detection must be interpreted very cautiously, especially if univariate datesets exhibit small sample sizes or skewed (i.e. non-normal) distributions. For example, data drawn from a Gamma distribution—bounded at zero and right-skewed—may naturally produce values flagged by Tukey’s rule even when no anomaly is present.\nUnivariate screening should therefore be viewed as a question-generating step, not an answer-generating one.",

A point may fall near the center of each marginal distribution yet be extreme in joint space. One tool that we can use is Mahalanobis Distance, which is a standard tool for identifying multivariate outliers because it accounts for covariance among variables. Conceptually, it measures distance from the multivariate centroid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhat the Mahalanobis distance means (plain language)\n\n\n\nThe Mahalanobis distance tells us how unusual a data point is when we consider several variables together.\n\\[\nD^2 = (x - \\mu)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x - \\mu)\n\\]\nThink of it this way:\n\n\\(x\\) = the values for one observation (e.g., oxygen and temperature at one site)\n\n\\(\\mu\\) = the average values across all observations\n\n\\((x - \\mu)\\) = how far that observation is from the “typical” point\n\n\\(\\Sigma^{-1}\\) = a correction that accounts for different units and correlations between variables\n\n\\(D^2\\) = a single number summarizing how extreme the observation is given the relationships in the data\n\nA point can look normal for each variable by itself, but still have a large Mahalanobis distance if it breaks the usual relationship between variables.\nThat’s why Mahalanobis distance is useful for finding multivariate (conditional) outliers, not just extreme values.\n\n\nIn practice, this can be implemented using existing R packages (e.g., stats::mahalanobis). For the dataset plotted above, the code here correctly flags the odd data point (complete, reproducible example):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(123)\nn &lt;- 120\n\nxy &lt;- tibble(\n  x = runif(n, min = 5.5, max = 8.5)\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    y = 14 * x - 20 + rnorm(n(), mean = 0, sd = 1)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  add_row(x = 7.0, y = 95.0) %&gt;%\n  mutate(is_conditional_outlier = row_number() == n())\n\n# --- Mahalanobis distance (stats::mahalanobis) ---\nX &lt;- as.matrix(xy %&gt;% select(x, y))\nmd &lt;- stats::mahalanobis(X, center = colMeans(X), cov = stats::cov(X))\n\n# Cutoff: chi-square quantile with df = 2 (x and y)\ncut &lt;- stats::qchisq(0.975, df = 2)\n\nxy &lt;- xy %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    md = md,\n    md_outlier = md &gt; cut\n  )\n\n# Which rows are flagged?\nxy %&gt;% filter(md_outlier) %&gt;% select(x, y, md, md_outlier, is_conditional_outlier)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n      x     y    md md_outlier is_conditional_outlier\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;lgl&gt;                 \n1     7    95  86.9 TRUE       TRUE                  \n\n\nAs with univariate methods, flagged points should prompt investigation—not automatic exclusion.\n\nIn the next section, we will apply the ante hoc Data Exploration Toolki to a real dataset.

The process of discovery is iterative across several parts of your workflow. So, just be patient with this first step.",

One simple option is to create a subfolder such as data/class_exercise_data (using the dir.create(\"data/class_exercise_data\") command to hold any example files used in class. If you need a refresher on project setup and organization, refer back to the Preparing Yourself section from Week 1.\nFirst, load the required packages by sourcing the file below.

For your convenience, I have provided the following file (right click on link to save the linked file to your drive):\n\nload_packages.r\n\nPlace this file into a folder called class_r_scripts (just a recommendation!).\n\nsource(\"class_r_scripts/load_packages.r\")\n\nYou should include this sourcing step at the beginning of all independent R scripts. The exception is if and when you use a formal reproducible analysis workflow packages (e.g. the targets package) or you need Quarto, which requires that you load packages and their dependencies in another way. This will require removing the source function below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe tidyverse meta-package in R\n\n\n\nKeep in my that the tidyverse package in R is a meta package and contains many standalone R packages, including:\n\nggplot2: declarative construction of statistical graphics\ndplyr: relational and vectorized data manipulation operations\ntidyr: restructuring datasets into tidy (rectangular) form\nreadr: standardized, high-performance import of tabular data\npurrr: functional programming utilities for iterative workflows\ntibble: enhanced data-frame representation with explicit printing semantics\nstringr: consistent, vectorized string processing\nforcats: handling and releveling of categorical variables",

Researchers observed that mudflats with higher densities of L. pelonate’s tended to have higher dissolved oxygen. At the same time, nearby forest salt licks provided salt that varied naturally across time and space, and L. pelonates were frequently observed foraging at them.\nTo test whether jackalope density and salt availability had causal effects on dissolved oxygen, the researchers constructed artificial mudflats and experimentally varied the number of L. pelonates (0–4 individuals) and salt availability (low, medium, high). Each unique combination was represented by a single mudflat, and dissolved oxygen was measured at each site. These are the data from that totally real experiment.\n\n\n\n\nTo do these exercises on your own, you will need the following files (right click on link to save the linked file to your drive):\n\nlepusantilocapra_pelonates_experiment.csv\nlepusantilocapra_climate_data.csv\n\nPlace the data files into your class_exercise_data folder.\nLet us read in these data and save it to an object called d (for “data”). Yes, according to best practices for naming, this could have a more informative name. Because this is (a) a singular dataset for a simple analysis, and (b) a simple class example, we will use a shorthand to prevent some extra keystrokes. But just know this is technically very bad practice. Also, for the sake of streamlining this example, this file has no associated metadata (this will be shown later when we get to the modeling phase). Already, we are flawed programmers.

    "text": "19.4 Examine the data structure\nFirst, we need to check the data types that were imported; this is a critical first step, as this can let you immediately detect any red flags. Though the str() (or the glimpse() function) is good for initial checking:\n\nstr(d)\n\n'data.frame':   45 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ number_jackalope: int  0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 ...\n $ salt_treatment  : chr  \"1_low\" \"1_low\" \"1_low\" \"1_low\" ...\n $ oxygen_ppm      : num  0.67 0.97 0.97 2.67 1.37 4.35 3.23 3 2.17 3.23 ...\n\n\nWe note that number_jackalope is an integer. We could certainly keep it like this, but, given how few categories there are (and the fact that this was an experimental condition), we decide that it is best to convert it to a factor.\n\nd &lt;- d |&gt;\n  mutate(number_jackalope = factor(number_jackalope )) |&gt;\n  mutate(salt_treatment = factor(salt_treatment))\n\nYou can then run str(d) or glimpse() again to see this change.\nLet us now examine how the treatments and the response variable are structured and if there are any statistical outliers. There are many approaches to this, and most of these formal outlier tests (Grubb’s test, Dixon’s Q test, and Rosner’s test) are based on the condition of dat normality. As such, they have context-dependent performance; that is, they fail at low sample sizes and have variable ability to detect outliers dependent on sample size. If you want to use these tests despite these weaknesses, you can find them in the EnvStats and outliers packages.\nIt is important at this step to avoid making any inferences about the relationships. As far as you, the responsible data analyst, are concerned, there are no relationships. You are simply looking for anything odd in the dataset: spurious datapoints, data outside the range of data (though you could use the range() function to see this), etc. Let us conduct a simple examination using one tabular and six graphical approaches:\n\nStep 1: Simple summary\nStep 2: Boxplot (Tukey-style)\nStep 3: Violin plot\nStep 4: Interaction plot\nStep 5: Scatterplot\nStep 6: Density plot\nStep 7: Heatmap\n\n\nSimple summary and examination of data structure\n\nsummary(d)\n\n number_jackalope  salt_treatment   oxygen_ppm    \n 0:9              1_low   :15     Min.   : 0.670  \n 1:9              2_medium:15     1st Qu.: 3.000  \n 2:9              3_high  :15     Median : 5.370  \n 3:9                              Mean   : 7.456  \n 4:9                              3rd Qu.:12.300  \n                                  Max.   :19.560  \n\n\nThis returns information about range, median value, and sample size within groups. Use this first to discover any major issues.\nYou can then graphically view aspects of your raw dataset. So, let us create a few plots using the ggplot2 package. Please refer to the ggplot2 Cheat Sheet (right click for download) for more information about this. Note that the following code does not use the pipe operator; this is just another way of doing things (it is good to see both in practice).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip**A recipe for a ggplot2 visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n` data |&gt; ggplot( aes( x = , y = ,  =  ) ) + geom_() + labs( title = “”, x = “”, y = “”,  ) + theme_() + \n`\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot (Tukey-style)\nThis is one of the oldest known ways of examining a data distribution concurrent with putative outliers. There are a few issues with the way\n\nggplot(d, aes(x = number_jackalope, y = oxygen_ppm, fill = salt_treatment)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Oxygen ppm by # jackalope and salt treatment\",\n       x = \"number of jackalope\",\n       y = \"Oxygen ppm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot\n\nggplot(d, aes(x = number_jackalope, y = oxygen_ppm, fill = salt_treatment)) +\n  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"distribution of oxygen ppm by # jackalope and salt treatment\",\n       x = \"number of jackalopes\",\n       y = \"oxygen ppm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause violin plots do not explicitly show outliers, they may be worse than Tukey-style boxplots for visual data exploration. Furthermore, violin plots may be harder to interpret than boxplot, may be space-inefficient (in terms of Tufte’s well-known call for reduced non-data ink in visualizations), and may smooth over important details of the data (i.e. it’s difficult to visually assess where the 25th and 75th percentiles are). Violin plots also can be misleading, especially with small sample sizes. Be cautious of their utility.\n\n\nInteraction plot\n\nggplot(d, aes(x = number_jackalope, y = oxygen_ppm)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~salt_treatment) +\n  labs(title = \"Oxygen ppm by number of jackalopes across salt treatments\",\n       x = \"# jackalope\",\n       y = \"oxygen ppm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization can give you a good idea about the variance within each unique treatment combination.\n\n\nScatter plot\n\nggplot(d, aes(x = number_jackalope, y = oxygen_ppm, color = salt_treatment, shape = salt_treatment)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"oxygen ppm scatter plot by # jackalope and salt treatment\",\n       x = \"# jackalope\",\n       y = \"oxygen ppm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plot\n\nggplot(d, aes(x = oxygen_ppm, fill = salt_treatment)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"density of oxygen ppm by salt treatment\",\n       x = \"oxygen ppm\",\n       y = \"density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us a good idea of the relative spread of each of salt_treatment response.

Recall that Tukey boxplots (as we have here) can tell us if there are potential outliers. This is how Tukey-style boxplots are defined. In our boxplot, we see two black dots each group that seem to be outside of the normal range of those groups. These are potential outliers. You should go back and examine these datapoints to see if there is anything strange about them. But be aware of how Tukey-style boxplots calculate outliers; it can be misleading if you do not understand Tukey’s original approach. Let u also examine the boxplots by different L. pelonates densities (i.e. the jackalope density treatments):\n\nd |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = number_jackalope, y = oxygen_ppm, fill = number_jackalope)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot by number of jackalope\", x = \"number_jackalope\", y = \"oxygen_ppm\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tukey boxplot is not showing any black “outlier” dots in the groups. So, using this approach, there do not seem to be any structural outliers. You can repeat this process on every variable in your dataset. It is generally effective for flagging major issues (anomalous values, etc.). Most likely, however, this approach will flag values that end up being perfectly reasonable. That is more than acceptable. At the very worst, you have put your eyes on the dataset a few more times.",

    "text": "19.7 Step 3: Inspecting for multicollinearity\nThe jackalopeologists then conducted a preliminary quantification of the climate in which L. pelonates was found. They used remote sensors to measure humidity, precipitation, temperature, temperature variability, and heating degree days. We don’t think we can include all the variables in our statistical model, so we want to first inspect if any of the variables are correlated (i.e. they tell us redundant information). Let’s read in these climate data and save it to an object called “climate”:\n\nclimate &lt;- import(\"class_exercise_data/lepusantilocapra_climate_data.csv\")\n\nAnd then look at the structure of the data:\n\nstr(climate)\n\n'data.frame':   37 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ humidity        : int  1 1 3 1 1 0 2 0 3 0 ...\n $ precipitation   : int  692 874 852 990 650 741 1301 368 1148 669 ...\n $ temperature     : num  94 100 106 112 116 ...\n $ temp_variation  : num  8.2 8.3 8.6 9.2 8.95 9.1 9.35 9.45 10.4 9.4 ...\n $ heating_deg_days: num  2710 2514 2334 2156 2048 ...\n\n\nNormally, we would have the associated metadata so that you could see the units for each of these variables. For this example, the units are not important.\nWe will proceed to visually examine multicollinearity (correlation) between these climate metrics, but we will also include–as a basic measure of strength of any correlation– the Pearson correlation metric. Let’s use a pairwise plot to visually inspect these. Note that the correlation coefficient (which varies between 0-1) is on the opposite diagonal from the graph.\n\nclimate |&gt;\n  ggpairs(\n    upper = list(continuous = \"cor\"),\n    lower = list(continuous = \"smooth\"),\n    diag  = list(continuous = \"barDiag\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# \"upper\" = Show Pearson correlation coefficients in the upper panel\n# \"lower\" = Optionally show scatterplots with smoothing in the lower panel\n# \"diag\"  = Optionally show histograms on the diagonal\n\nThe GGally::ggpairs function markedly improves upon similar functionality of base R. What do we see? We see that:\n\nhumidity and precipitation are strongly and positively correlated (r = 0.648)\ntemperature and temperature variation are strongly and positively correlated (r = 0.584)\ntemperature and heating degree days are strongly and negatively correlated (r = -0.998)\ntemperature variation and heating degree days are strongly and negatively correlated (r = -0.588)\n\nSo, what to do, what to do, what to do? The next part is one solution to this issue. We clearly have some variables that might be providing redundant information. This could impact our modeling (specifically inflating the variance of a given regression coefficient). We can explicitly examine this using Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs), which are calculated for each term in a model. Note that there are options for VIFs applied to both continuous and categorical variables. Let us do this for continuous variables for these climate data. Most available functions in R require regression models; however, there are some approaches–such as the usdm package–that require only data frames of multiple variables. So, let us use that.:\n\nvif_results &lt;- usdm::vif(climate)\nvif_results\n\n         Variables        VIF\n1         humidity   1.774591\n2    precipitation   1.764116\n3      temperature 244.453457\n4   temp_variation   1.555291\n5 heating_deg_days 246.129937\n\n\nThis is a clear example that two variables, temperature and heating_deg_days, are highly correlated with a number of other variables. That is, they potentially provide redundant information.\nIf variables are negatively correlated, consider retaining them both. From there, you can decide to:\n\nEliminate one of the positively correlated variables from our analysis.\nConduct a factor-reduction analysis to create a new variable that captures the correlated variation between correlated variables.\n\nThe former sounds lazy and arbitrary. Let us proceed with a factor reduction approach. For this, one of the most widely accepted approaches is a principal components analysis (PCA). There are many related factor reduction methods out there as well that may work better for non-normal data, etc., but PCA generally works fairly well.\nOur first step is to conduct a PCA without specifying how many new components (new variables) should be generated.\n\npca_results &lt;- stats::princomp(\n  ~ humidity + precipitation + temperature + temp_variation + heating_deg_days,\n  data = climate,\n  cor = TRUE\n) # using the namespace operator\n\nNote that the above code does not work with pipes. This behavior happens sometimes with tidy.\nLet us now examine the results output, specifically the standard deviation values (i.e. “Comp.1”, etc.). If you square these values, you will have what is called an eigenvalue, where values &gt;1 indicate that the new principal component accounts for more variance than the original variables. So, your first step is square the standard deviations and then use this eigenvalue to decide how many new components (i.e. new variables) to retain.\n\npca_results$sdev ^ 2  # this squares the standard deviations\n\n     Comp.1      Comp.2      Comp.3      Comp.4      Comp.5 \n2.688766244 1.452196831 0.507234299 0.349760919 0.002041707 \n\n\nIt looks like the first two components work well. Now, we want to force a PCA to contain just two components, and we want those two variables to be as independent as follows. We therefore conduct what is called a rotated PCA to achieve maximum information of each component. Note that we are now using the principal function found in the psych package:\n\npca_results_rotated &lt;- psych::principal(climate, nfactors = 2, rotate = \"varimax\", covar = FALSE) # using a namespace operator\npca_results_rotated$loadings\n\n\nLoadings:\n                 RC1    RC2   \nhumidity         -0.124  0.892\nprecipitation            0.905\ntemperature       0.944 -0.196\ntemp_variation    0.799       \nheating_deg_days -0.945  0.196\n\n                 RC1   RC2\nSS loadings    2.444 1.697\nProportion Var 0.489 0.339\nCumulative Var 0.489 0.828\n\n\nLet’s dissect this. First, look at the loadings table. These show the linear correlations between the rotated principal components (RC1 and RC2) and the original climate variables. Therefore, RC1 is strongly correlated with temperature, temperature variation, and heating degree days, whereas RC2 is correlated with humidity and precipitation.\nYou can see this generally reflected when you plot PCA axes of variation. A safe default is to biplot the princomp() object:\n\nbiplot(pca_results)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne advantage of PCA/ICA or other factor reduction methods is that you can use expert knowledge to decide on the number of resulting axes. Certainly, in the end, these may not capture much total variation. This flexibility may improve interpretability.\nWe can then create two new rotated scores for each observation (row). But what are these new values? These are simply new continous values that capture the variation attributable to the set of variables that correlated with each rotated component (PC1, PC2, etc.).\nThe statistical convention in most fields is to accept all rotated components that sum to &gt;80% of cumulative explained variation. You can output these new rotated scores by running the following code and then inputting these as new columns in your dataset. Then, run the model with each of these new proxy variables as new factors in your model(s):\n\npca_results_rotated$scores\n\n            RC1         RC2\n1  -2.297743319 -0.93979095\n2  -1.615079146 -0.56215540\n3  -0.742103374  0.43524344\n4   0.168491793 -0.07924539\n5   0.175054065 -0.81591440\n6   0.319233549 -1.07322356\n7  -0.151659949  1.05198229\n8  -1.153591365 -1.67740452\n9   1.731717862  1.53557338\n10  1.531908063 -1.13298910\n11 -0.710144408 -0.01812957\n12 -0.835747218  0.30459876\n13  0.642890086 -0.30633196\n14 -0.163440060  0.94065321\n15 -0.005344451 -0.47011057\n16  0.593689628  0.62454354\n17 -0.537374119 -0.19831498\n18  1.575800238  0.43229319\n19  1.236151237  0.89397481\n20  0.837959614 -1.25849702\n21  0.815647774 -0.81482061\n22 -0.001440188  0.48095893\n23  0.684009759  0.72280254\n24  0.679808842  0.25259784\n25 -0.882679835 -0.23250232\n26  0.367779897  1.47725934\n27 -0.619318068 -1.21317733\n28 -0.983554574 -0.13256898\n29 -0.027524574 -0.59730235\n30  1.368900971 -0.86595054\n31  1.536240251 -0.64932937\n32  0.688559658 -0.20506311\n33 -0.105285111 -0.35740682\n34 -1.659241971 -0.15264062\n35 -0.749029761  0.32033636\n36 -0.444050160  0.60008159\n37 -1.269491637  3.67997024",
