    "text": "2.1 Welcome to Quantitative Analysis of (Messy) Field Data!\nThanks for joining us this term! I couldn’t be more pleased at the large size of the class this term! This means that there are more perspectives to help guide us through the following phases of data analysis:\nThe complexity of the project, difficulty of field conditions, or an impending deadline can make the jumps from data collection to inference horribly daunting to young and old researchers alike. Our joint goal in this course is to become more comfortable with each of these steps, so that we not only work more efficiently but we also know a bit more about how to sense of our complex world. It is my sincerest hope that this course will not only teach you some about statistics (and some statistical traps) but that it will also give you a unique opportunity to work with your peers as you delve into the myriad issues that inevitably arise in data analysis. Working together means that we must first acknowledge that each one of us assimilates new material and produces syntheses in varied ways. All I ask is that each of you",

    "text": "2.2 Course Objectives\nBy the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\nThink quantitatively about messy ecological data. You should be on your way to developing a habit of translating real-world ecological questions into quantitative frameworks, while explicitly acknowledging uncertainty and bias in estimation and measurement.\nDistinguish between questions/hypotheses, data, and inferences. You should be able to (1) clearly separate ecological hypotheses, the data actually collected, and the quantities being estimated, and (2) understand why these distinctions matter for interpretation and decision-making.\nUnderstand the processes that generate data. You should be able to recognize how different study designs, variation in detection, observer effects, instrument error, and data processing shape and constrain the structure of ecological datasets.\nSelect, build, and critique statistical models as scientific tools. You should be comfortable choosing and using statistical models not as black boxes, but as explicit representations of assumptions about ecological processes, variation, and causal structure. You should never blindly choose a statistical model again!\nInterpret results in ecological —not just statistical— terms. You should be able to conceptually move beyond p-values and coefficients to clearly articulate what your results mean biologically, mechanistically, and practically.\nBe comfortable applying causal –and not just correlational– reasoning. You should be able to use causal thinking (conceptual models and directed acyclic graphs) to evaluate what can —and ehat cannot— be inferred from observational and experimental data.\nCommunicate quantitative results clearly, transparently, and honestl.y Present analyses, figures, and conclusions in ways that are transparent, reproducible, and appropriate for scientific audiences.\nDevelop durable, reproducible analytical workflows. You should be increasingly comfortable with good data-science practices that support clarity, versioning (even though we will not delve into GitHub this term), and reusability of analyses.\nDevelop new confidence working with unfamiliar, complex, imperfect datasets. You should leave this course better prepared to engage with real ecological data —without expecting it to be clean, complete, or simple.",

    "section": "2.3 What is new this term (Spring 2026)?",
    "text": "2.3 What is new this term (Spring 2026)?\nFor Spring 2026, I have added attention to new topics that improve both efficiency of analysis workflows and our ability to understand causality at a deeper level. Specifically, I have chosen to add course components on:\n\nUsing large-language models (LLMs) –via ChatGPT– to improve analytical workflows. This term, I have integrated ChatGPT into the course as a way to support the process of analysis rather than to automate the analysis itself. Many of the hardest parts of quantitative work happen outside of writing code: figuring out why R code isn’t behaving as expected, checking whether an interpretation actually follows from a model, troubleshooting an obscure error message, or getting feedback on how tp clearly document a decision. Used carefully, ChatGPT can act like a sounding board for troubleshooting, sanity-checking, and refining explanations without taking over your critical thinking. Throughout the course, I have deliberately constrained ChatGPT’s role and scope and have tailored its guardrails to match the course progression. In other words, ChatGPT is used to help improve analytical workflow and decision-making, not to generate results or write code on a student’s behalf. We will work together to assess the utility of this tool as the term advances.\n\n\n\n\nUsing large-language models (LLMs) to improve teaching at scale. What does this mean? In past terms, between 10-15 students have been enrolled in this course. This term, I have allowed 26 students to enroll. Without a Teaching Assistant, this spawns a significant issue of scale. This is solvable if we use AI as a helpful tool. So, after spending some time as an LLM-consultant and tester, I decided to explicitly integrate chatGPT’s LLMs into my teaching/grading workflow. This means that students will use a custom GPT that I created specifically for ZOO/ECOL-5500 called JackalopeGPT (using ChatGPT) to run checks on their work prior to submission; this will solve some of the “tuning” issues (with codes, grammar, clarity, etc.) that I have seen in student submissions in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) I added Structural Causal Models (SCMs) at the end of the course to give us a way to think more clearly about complex systems where multiple variables influence each other at the same time. In the first part of the course, students will see the limits of fitting separate models (e.g. GLMs, GLMMs, GAMMs) for singular response variables; those models can work individually, but they often miss shared drivers, indirect effects, or how pieces of the complex system of exogenous and endogenous factors fit together. SCMs give us a way to lay out those relationships explicitly and analyze them as a connected structure (as is present in natural systems) rather than as a collection of isolated models. The goal isn’t to replace the modeling approaches we’ve already used but to improve inference by making our assumptions about the system clear and coherent.\nJackalopes! This course corrects a long-standing perspective that (1) jackalopes had deer-like antlers (Fig. 1), and (2) there was only a single species of jackalopes (Fig. 2). We will use the newly discovered cryptid ecosystem for course exercises and examples.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Illustrations of the correct and incorrect ornament morphology of jackalopes.",

Faculty can help direct you or you may find info about UW policy and resources at http://www.uwyo.edu/reportit. While we want you to feel comfortable coming to us with issues you may be struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that we have some reporting requirements that are part of our job requirements at UW. You do not have to go through the experience alone. For example, if you inform us of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination we will keep the information as private as we can, but we am required to bring it to the attention of the institution’s Title IX Coordinator. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, you can contact Equal Opportunity Report and Response (Bureau of Mines Room 319, 766-5200, report-it@uwyo.edu, www.uwyo.edu/reportit).

    "text": "5.2 Purpose\nThis document reviews principles, guard rails, and documentation practices for the responsible use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in scientific research and analysis. One such GenAI tool that most of us are familiar with is ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a GenAI model that can detect (and arguably understand) and generate human-like text by predicting what comes next in a sentence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are very advanced GenAI systems trained on absolutely massive amounts of text to answer complex questions, write in certain rhetorical tones, summarize information, or have conversations in natural language. Given this tool’s widespread utility, it can certainly be misused. Therefore, the guidelines below attempt to ensure that GenAI augments human reasoning without compromising scientific validity, reproducibility, or accountability. In all aspects of the present academic work, GenAI tools like ChatGPT are therefore treated as assistive tools –comparable to statistical software (like R) or calculators– not as autonomous analysts or skilled authors.",

    "text": "5.3 Core principles of responsible use of GenAI\n\nAccountability: The human researcher retains full responsibility for –and is held accountable for– all analytical decisions, interpretations, text and code, and inference. The use of GenAI does not relieve any burdens of authorship, responsibility, or liability. Importantly, this means that the human researcher is allowed –and, in most cases, is encouraged– to use AI-produced code, as long as the research has vetted and error-checked. This likewise assumes that the researcher accepts responsibility for any and all errors arising from AI assistance. That is, GenAI may accelerate work, but it may not replace understanding. If a researcher cannot defend a decision without the GenAI present, the decision is invalid.\nScientific Primacy: Scientific reasoning precedes and constrains GenAI use. Hypotheses, data-generating assumptions, and model structures must be defined by the researcher. GenAI may clarify or critique these decisions but may not create them from scratch without human justification.\nTransparency: All GenAI use must be documented in a way that allows another scientist to understand how GenAI influenced the work. GenAI-assisted reasoning must be distinguishable from original analysis.\nReproducibility: All results must be reproducible without access to GenAI tools. Data, code, and associated documentation must be sufficient to reproduce results independently. GenAI may assist development but must not be a hidden dependency.\nProportionality: The level of documentation naturally should be proportional to the influence of GenAI. Minor stylistic assistance requires minimal logging, while conceptual or analytical assistance requires a larger volume of explicit documentation and justification.",

AI absolutely must not invent methods, results, or citations.\nCode Understanding: GenAI may explain what existing code does, diagnose warnings or errors conceptually, and suggest stylistic or reproducibility improvements. AI may not replace independent code comprehension.\n\n\n\n\nProhibited or Restricted Uses of GenAIin Scientific Work\n\nReplacement of Scientific Judgment: GenAI must not be used to select models, error distributions, priors, or random-effects structures without independent human justification, nor to interpret results without verification.\nUndocumented Analysis Generation: GenAI must not generate full end-to-end analytical pipelines without explanation, or produce black-box code whose logic is not understood by the researcher.\nFabrication: GenAI must not be used to invent data, methods, results, or citations, or to create post-hoc justifications unsupported by the analysis.\nOutcome Optimization: GenAI must not be used to iteratively prompt for statistically significant results, improved AIC values, or exaggerated certainty.",

(This is a required component for students in ZOO/ECOL-5500 starting Spring 2026)\n\nRequired Information: Entries record the date, GenAI tool used, purpose of interaction, nature of assistance provided, key takeaway, and the verification step performed.\nWhen Logging Is Required: Logging is required when GenAI influences model choice, interpretation, methodological justification, or scientific claims. Minor stylistic or grammatical use does not require detailed logging.\nVerification Obligations: Any GenAI-suggested content must be independently verified using primary literature, software documentation, diagnostic checks, or independent reasoning. Unverified AI output must not appear in final analyses.\nAuthorship and Attribution: GenAI tools are not authors and do not receive citation credit. If required by journals or funders, GenAI use may be acknowledged in a neutral Methods or Acknowledgments statement.\nEthical Safeguards: GenAI use must not obscure uncertainty, inflate confidence, reduce methodological transparency, or disadvantage collaborators or students with limited access to AI tools.",

    "text": "Join the ZOO-5500 Slack (private link sent via email)\nDownload, Install, and set up RStudio Desktop\nGather your dataset files for your analysis\n\n\n6.1.1 Join the ZOO-5500 Slack\nJust click on the list and follow instructions. We will use Slack to encourage ongoing, low-stakes discussion within the class. This will be for sharing questions, ideas, and insights in real time so that learning can continue outside of scheduled class meetings. This allows everyone (even me) to get answers to questions that I might be thinking about at odd times. It also allows for problems to be solved faster; rather than waiting until our synchronous Zoom session to ask about an issue, we can group-think over the course of the week. Remember that this is set up to improve collaboration; it does not mean that anyone should be responding outside of work hours or on the weekends. Below are the preferred channels for different kinds of communication:\n\n#announcements &gt;Read-only channel for important course information like deadlines, corrections, and post-class clarifications. Check this regularly.\n#course-questions &gt;For general course or assignment questions (due dates, unclear wording on websites) that others might also have. Expect peer responses and occasional instructor follow-ups.\n#data-help &gt;For data wrangling and technical data issues (imports, joins, NAs, plots). Not for model choice or interpretation.\n#model-talk &gt;For conceptual questions about models and assumptions. Discussion-focused; no code debugging.\n#analysis-workflow &gt;For questions about reproducibility, organization, reporting, and good analytical habits.\n#ai-use-and-logs For discussing allowed AI use and posting AI interaction logs when requested. No private communication or graded work.\n#papers-good-bad-ugly &gt;For highlighting examples of good and bad analyses in published work.\n#random &gt;For off-topic chat, random links, and fun stuff. This will help keep everything else focused.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Download, Install, and set up RStudio Desktop\nInstall on your local machine. All coding and file organization will be done in RStudio. Note that the following is a very basic way of creating a set of project folders. You will see boxes with R code. Feel free to copy and run these, if necessary. Here are the basic steps:\n\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop. Navigate to your folder (in this case, your student folder).\nIn “Files” window (lower right panel in RStudio), click “More/Set as Working Directory”. This sets your working directory; this is always a good idea to do.\nCreate a New R Project in your student folder: “File/New Project/Existing Directory”. Name this project appropriately.\nCreate your File structure: Refer to this RStudio tutorial. In this class, we will modify this set of directories to make things a bit easier and more transparent for you. After completing the following steps, place your dataset in your “data/raw_data” folder (after you create it below). Navigate to this folder on your computer and drag-and-drop or copy-paste your data file(s) into this folder.\n\nCreate three folders (one suggested framework):\n\n/data (for raw, processed, clean datasets)\n/r_scripts (for R scripts, each containing a set of related functions)\n/output output (for models, graphs, tables)\n\nWe can do this by staying in our directory (within RStudio) and then using the dir.create function.\n\ndir.create(\"data\")\n\nYou can see your new folder (“data”) appear in the Files in the lower right window within RStudio. Now let’s create the other two folders.\n\ndir.create(\"r_scripts\")\ndir.create(\"output\")\n\nTo help with data processing (i.e. cleaning and organization)–something that we will discuss in coming days within the context of your analytical workflow–, we will create some subfolders within your newly created “data” folder. Let’s do this now. Note how you create a folder within the “data” folder by specifying the path:\n\ndir.create(\"data/raw_data\")\ndir.create(\"data/processed_data\")\ndir.create(\"data/metadata\")\n\nAnd that is how you create a basic R Project in RStudio! What you have done is create a set of folders and subfolders that have names that can be easily understood by other users. Feel free to create other subfolders now. Or, should you not like the file nomenclature used above, change the names to whatever you wish. Just be sure that this structure is as simple as possible so that other users understand what you have done.\nThere is an added benefit to creating an R Project in this way. What you have done is create a minimally reproducible data structure. There are two primary ways this can be accomplished (if you are not familiar with this. First method: A collaborator (or instructor or classmate) can simply navigate to your subfolder, set that as their working directory from within RStudio, and then open the .RProj file. Alternatively, you can create zip your root folder (the one labelled as your name, in this case) and then share your entire analysis, etc. All the recipient would need to do is unzip the folder, open the .Rproj file, and then “Set as Working Directory.”\n\n\n6.1.3 Gather your dataset files for your analysis\nPlace your data in your “data/raw_data” subfolder and then confirm that your files are present by running the list.files function.\n\nlist.files(\"data/raw_data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWorking order means more than a spreadsheet or two.\nA dataset is only complete if it includes metadata. Metadata describe: - what the variables are\n- how the data were collected\n- under what conditions\n- with what assumptions and limitations\nIf you have questions about metadata, I have an old, dedicated lecture on metadata structures, and I strongly encourage you to reach out.\n\n\nYou are now ready to move to the next steps of loading necessary R packages and beginning your journey of data exploration!",

    "text": "Universal Milestone Grading Rubric\nThe Traffic Signal Grading Scale applies to all Milestone Assignments. Grading reflects scientific readiness relative to the purpose of the milestone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\n🟢 GREEN: Good to Proceed\n🟡 YELLOW: Exercise Caution\n🔴 RED: Stop and Rework\n\n\n\n\nPurpose & intent\nClearly meets the core intent of the milestone\nPartially meets intent; key elements need revision\nDoes not meet the core intent of the milestone\n\n\nQuestion or objective\nClear, focused, and appropriate for this stage\nPresent but vague, drifting, or overly broad\nUnclear, unfocused, or missing\n\n\nAlignment (question–data–methods)\nQuestion, data, and approach are coherently aligned\nPartial alignment; gaps or weak links remain\nFundamental mismatch between components\n\n\nReasoning & assumptions\nReasoning is coherent; assumptions or limitations acknowledged\nReasoning incomplete or assumptions implicit\nReasoning unclear or unsupported\n\n\nClaims & language\nClaims are appropriate for the stage of analysis\nSome overreach or ambiguous language\nClaims exceed what the work can support\n\n\nCourse GPT self-check\nUsed appropriately; issues addressed or justified\nUsed, but issues only partially addressed\nLittle or no meaningful evidence of self-checking\n\n\nScientific readiness\nWork is ready to move to the next stage\nViable but requires targeted revision\nNot yet in a usable scientific state\n\n\n\nThis universal grading scale is meant to help you quickly understand where your work stands, not to highlight small mistakes. My goal here is to make expectations clear, keep grading transparent, and help you focus on doing solid, defensible science –all without unnecessary stress over points or formatting (which we will let GenAI work on for you). The scale’s primary benefits include:\n\nIt is easy to read. The traffic light color scheme (green, yellow, and red) tell you right away whether your work is ready to move forward, needs some fixing, or needs a more substantial rethink (the majority of good scientists’ ideas)\nIt is the same for every assignment. I use this scale for all milestone assignments. Therefore, the standards are predictable for every assignment.\nIt centers on scientific readiness, not scientific perfection (which, technically, does not exist). You are not being graded on having the “right” answer. What matters most to me is whether your question, data, and reasoning co-exist coherently together.\nIt matches how real science works. Research almost never gets it right on the first try; drafts, checks, and revisions are normal.\nIt allows for rapid feedback. GenAI will do some of the busy work associated with troubleshooting coding issues or improving clarity, which will give me more time to gauge the scientific readiness of your work. A win-win for us all!",
