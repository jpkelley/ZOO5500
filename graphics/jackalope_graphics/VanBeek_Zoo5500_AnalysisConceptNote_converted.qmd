## Project overview

---

### Title: *How Fences Impact Ungulate Movement*

---

### Research question

1. What is the probability an ungulate will cross a fence once it is encountered?(Primary)
2. How much time do ungulates spend trying to cross a fence?(Secondary)

---

### Study system and units of analysis

* **Study Site:**
  + Box X Ranch Alzada, MT
* **Data:**
  + 19 camera sites (2 cameras per site) placed along fences to be removed (treatment), kept (control), or randomly on the landscape
  + This includes 7 treatment sites, 6 control sites, and 6 random sites.
  + All cameras are set up in pairs. Within a pair, each camera is placed about 3 meters from the other, angled away from the opposing camera at about a 45 degree. For treatment and control sites cameras are set up on either side of the fence in the same manner.
  + Camera sites were choosen by finding high use ungulate areas via sign (tracks and scat) along fences.
  + All cameras are programmed to take 1 photo every 15 minutes from sunrise to sunset. All cameras are also programmed to take 1 photo every 3 seconds when motion triggered
  + Cameras will remain on the landscape for 1 year prior to fence removal and one year after fence removal.
  + For purposes of this course, only photos before fence removal will be analyzed.
* **Unit of analysis:**
  + A single row of data represents a series of temporally consecutive photos (bursts).

## Data description

---

### Data source

* Data come from field work at the Box X ranch.
* Data for this course will be observational. Eventually will be experimental (fence removal).
* I am the original collector of the data

---

### Response variable(s)

List your primary response variable(s):

* Variable name (as it appears in the data): Cross  

* What it represents conceptually: Whether an animal crossed the fence or not
* Operational rule: An ungulate was moving towards the fence and was detected by a single camera but not the other within a camera site.
* Measurement scale / type (count, binary, continuous, proportion, etc.): Binary
* Units (if applicable): NA

---

### Predictor variable(s)

List your main predictors (draft list is fine):

* Predictor name(s): Presence of fence
* Conceptual meaning of predictors: “”
* Expected direction of effect (if any): Presence of fence will impede crossing of ungualtes
* Why it matters for your question: Directly related to my question.

---

## Hypotheses and expectations

* H1: Fences influence ungulate permeability.
  + P1.1: Fences will decrease crossing probability of ungulates.

---

## Planned analytical approach (tentative)

### Candidate model family

*What type of model do you currently think is appropriate, and why?*  

*GLMM: I have a binary response, non-independence, and would like to add random effects such as site id and date.*

---

### Data structure considerations

* Detection bias (imperfect detection)
* Spatial bias (some cameras will be in higher ungulate use areas than others)
* Lots of photos (or time periods) with no ungulate activity.

---

## Workflow and reproducibility plan

---

### File organization

*Briefly describe how you plan to organize your project files.*

* BoxX: *where you can find your files*
  + CamPhotos:
  + Scripts:
  + RawData:
  + CleanData:

---

### AI use (planned)

*I plan to use AI for analysis idea generating and trouble shooting code and analysis problems*

---

## Anticipated challenges

*What do you already think might be difficult or limiting?*  

*Imperfect detection and/or difficult to interpret photo bursts. For example, if I get a single photo of a pronghorn, can I say it crossed or did not cross?*

---

## What success looks like at this stage

*To build an analysis that quantifies the probability of crossing a fence at each of the 19 camera sites.*

---

## Notes for Patrick (optional)

*The overall goal for my study is to see how ungulates react to fence removal. However, we wont be removing fence until next summer. I was thinking I can still can analyze crossing attempts at fences for this course, which will obviously be used on the larger analysis later on. Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on what I should be doing for this course based on the data I currently have? In short, I’ll have pictures of pronghorn and deer near fences and I’m broadly interested in how fences affect crossing probabilities, the amount of time an animal takes to cross, and movement metrics and/or habitat use when in close proximity to the fence (ie., viewshed of the camera).*

## JackalopeGPT Pre-Submission Evaluation (Required)

| \_ | Dimension | Rating | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Task clarity** | **Strong** | Research questions are precise and hierarchically ordered. | None required. |
| **Scope appropriateness** | **Strong** | Pre-removal, observational, single behavioral outcome. | None required. |
| **Units & data mapping** | **Strong** | Unit explicitly redefined as a burst (temporally consecutive photos). | Specify how bursts are delimited (time gap rule). |
| **Response variable validity** | **Adequate → Strong** | Operational rule stated; better aligned with burst-level data. | Frame “Cross” as a *proxy for passage* to avoid overclaiming. |
| **Predictor definition** | **Adequate** | Fence presence conceptually clear. | Clarify how predictor varies across sites in pre-removal data (fenced vs random). |
| **Causal alignment** | **Strong** | Hypotheses now match data and observational design. | None required. |
| **Model–data fit** | **Strong** | GLMM appropriate; non-independence acknowledged. | Consider random effects for site and camera-pair; date optional. |
| **Bias & limitations awareness** | **Strong** | Detection and misclassification risks explicitly noted. | You may briefly note directional bias from camera placement. |
| **Reproducibility plan** | **Strong** | File structure and AI-use plan are clear. | None required. |
| **Instructor usability** | **Strong** | Clean, consistent, revisions clearly address earlier critiques. | None required. |
