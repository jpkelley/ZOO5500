This course was created using Quarto (via R Studio) using custom CSS and HTML.

## **AI usage transparency** {.unnumbered}

In the construction of this website, GenAI (via ChatGPT) was used in the following ways:

* **Generating graphics of cryptid jackalope species.** This was part of an exercise in prompt engineering—specifically, learning how to design minimalist prompts that produce consistent visual themes across all outputs.

* **Converting the Canvas-based course site into Quarto markdown.** This included restructuring content, standardizing headers, and translating existing materials into a reproducible, version-controlled format (for hosting on GitHub).

* **Assistive learning of custom CSS**, in parallel with consulting online CSS documentation and manuals (i.e., as a tutor and debugger, not a design authority).

* **Reformatting and updating existing tables**, including updating of revised dates, assignments, and course logistics.

* **Error-checking and troubleshooting markdown and Quarto code.** This was necessary during site builds.

* **Improving organization across course components.** This included suggestions for cross-referencing related pages and identifying places where additional examples or clarifications would improve learning outcomes.

* **Evaluating pedagogical alignment.** This involved getting feedback on readability, cognitive load, and whether learning objectives were being met by the material being presented.

* **Editorial support** to ensure that tone and level of explanatory detail was appropriate for graduate students. This included tightening some language and reducing informational redundancy across pages.

GenAI was used as an assistive tool throughout; it was not used as a content authority, decision-maker, or substitute for subject-matter expertise. All instructional choices, interpretations, and final edits remain the responsibility of the instructor (in accordance with [AI Use Policy](../chapters/ai_policy.qmd)).
